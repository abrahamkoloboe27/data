"Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah, ","Ezekiyási ka ji Manasée; Manasée ji Amɔ́ni, bɔ Amɔ́ni ji Joziyási; "
and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon. ,Joziyási ka ji Jekoniyási kpódó nɔví tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó hwenu e ahwan wlí mɛ lɛ́ɛ hɛn yi Babilɔ́nu é.

"Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Christ.

"This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. ","Lě e è ji Jezu Klísu gbɔn ɔ́ ɖíe: Mali, Jezu sín nɔ ɔ́, asixɔ́ntɔn Jozɛ́fu tɔn wɛ é nyí; yě ká kó jɛ kpɔ́ cóbɔ é mɔ Jezu sín xo gbɔn Yɛsinsɛn sín nǔwiwa gbla mɛ ǎ. "
"Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. ","Jozɛ́fu Mali xɔ́ntɔn ɔ́, gbɛtɔ́ ɖé wɛ, bó nɔ́ nyi Mɔyízisɛ́n ɔ́ ganjí. É jló ná dó winnyá asi tɔn ǎ, bó ɖo linlin dó ayi mɛ wɛ ɖɔ émí ná jó e dó ɖo nǔglɔ́. "
"But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. ","Nǔ énɛ́ lin kpɔ́n wɛ é ɖe, bɔ wɛnsagun Aklúnɔ tɔn wá xo dlɔ̌ ɛ bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Jozɛ́fu Davídi ví, xɛsi ma ɖi we, nú a gɔn Mali da ó; ɖó xo e é mɔ ɔ́, Yɛsinsɛn sín nǔwiwa wɛ. "
"She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.” ","É ná ji vǐ súnnu ɖokpó, bɔ a nǎ sun nyǐ vǐ ɔ́ ɖɔ Jezu, ɖó é ná hwlɛ́n togun tɔn gán sín hwɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ.” "
All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: ,Nǔ e jɛ nɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ sɔgbe xá xó e Aklúnɔ kó ɖɔ ɖ'ayǐ gbɔn gbeyíɖɔ tɔn jí é: 
"“The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel” –which means, “God with us.” ","“É ɖíe, nyɔ̌nu ɖo alɔjí ná mɔ xo, bó ná ji vǐ súnnu ɖokpó, bɔ è nǎ sun nyǐ i ɖɔ Emanuwɛ́li.” (Nyǐkɔ énɛ́ ɔ́ sín tínmɛ wɛ nyí: “Mawu ɖo kpɔ́ xá mǐ.”) "
"When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. ","Ée Jozɛ́fu fɔ́n sín amlɔ mɛ ɔ́, é bló nǔ e wɛnsagun Aklúnɔ tɔn ɖɔ n'i ɔ́ ɖ'é jí, bó yí asi tɔn dó xwé gbe. "
"But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem ","Lo ɔ́, é ɖó xó xá ɛ, káká cóbɔ é ji vǐ ɔ́ ǎ.

"and asked, “Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.” ","Ée yě wá ɔ́, yě ɖɔ: “Fítɛ́ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ xɔ́sú e è ji ɔ́ ɖe? Ɖó mǐ mɔ sunví e ɖe jiji tɔn xlɛ́ ɔ́ ɖo zǎnzǎnhwe jí fí e mǐ gosín ɔ́, bó wá xwé kanbyɔ́ gbé.” "
"When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him. ","Ée axɔ́sú Elódu se xó énɛ́ ɔ́, ayi tɔn bǐ gbadó é kpódó Jeluzalɛ́mu togun ɔ́ bǐ kpó, "
"When he had called together all the people's chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Christ was to be born. ","bɔ é ylɔ́ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ bǐ kplé kpódó sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó, lobo kan fí e è ɖǒ ná ji Klísu ɖe ɔ́ byɔ́ yě. "
"“In Bethlehem in Judea,” they replied, “for this is what the prophet has written: ","Yě ká yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Bɛteleyɛ́mu, Judée yíkúngban jí wɛ, ɖó Mawu kó ɖɔ gbɔn gbeyíɖɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ jí ɖɔ: "
"“ ‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel.’ ” ","‘Hwɛ, Bɛteleyɛ́mu, toxo e ɖo Juda yíkúngban jí é!

Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared. ,"Elódu ka zɔ́n, bɔ è yi ylɔ́ nǔnywɛ́tɔ́ lɛ́ɛ wá n'i. Ée yě wá ɔ́, é kplá yě yi kpá, bo kan hwenu e sunví ɔ́ tɔ́n dó ɔ́ byɔ́ yě tlítlí. "
"He sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and make a careful search for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him.” ","Énɛ́ gúdo ɔ́, é nyi nǔnywɛ́tɔ́ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ sɛ́ dó Bɛteleyɛ́mu bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi yi ba do nú vǐ ɔ́ céɖécéɖé, mi ka mɔ ɛ hǔn, mi wá ɖɔ nú mì, nú nyɛ lɔmɔ̌ ná yi kan xwé byɔ́.” "
"After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. ","Ée axɔ́sú ɔ́ ɖɔ mɔ̌ nú yě gúdo ɔ́, yě jɛ ali. Sunví e tɔ́n bɔ yě kó mɔ ɖ'ayǐ ɔ́ wá jɛ nukɔn nú yě.

"On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, yě byɔ́ xwé ɔ́ gbe, bó mɔ vǐ ɔ́ kpódó nɔ tɔn kpó, bó jɛ kpo, bó ɖe kɔ́ n'i; yě hun gbǎví yětɔn lɛ́ɛ, bó kan agban n'i; yě ná ɛ siká, bó ná ɛ zǎlínkpɔ́n kpódó célu xɔ akwɛ́ ɖé kpán, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ célu ɔ́ ɖɔ Mǐla.

"And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route. ",Mawu ka wá xo dlɔ̌ yě ɖɔ yě ní ma sɔ́ lɛ́ kɔ gbɔn Elódu gɔ́n ó
"When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get up,” he said, “take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.” ","Ée nǔnywɛ́tɔ́ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ yi gúdo ɔ́, wɛnsagun Aklúnɔ tɔn wá xo dlɔ̌ Jozɛ́fu bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Sí te, zě vǐ ɔ́, kplá nɔ tɔn, bó hɔn yi Ejípu; nɔ dɔ̌n káká yi jɛ hwenu e un ná lɛ́ wá ɖɔ xó nú we dó é. Ɖó Elódu ɖo vǐ ɔ́ ba ná hu wɛ.” "
"So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, ","Jozɛ́fu ka sí te zǎn ɔ́ mɛ nǔgbó, bó zé vǐ ɔ́, bó kplá vǐ ɔ́ sín nɔ, bɔ yě hɔn yi Ejípu, "
where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called my son.” ,"lobo nɔ fínɛ́ káká jɛ hwenu e Elódu kú é. Nǔ nyí mɔ̌, nú xó e Aklúnɔ ko ɖɔ ɖ'ayǐ gbɔn gbeyíɖɔ tɔn jí ɔ́ ná dó jɛ; é wɛ nyí ɖɔ: “Un ylɔ́ vǐ ce sín Ejípu.” "
"When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi. ","Ée Elódu mɔ ɖɔ nǔnywɛ́tɔ́ lɛ́ɛ flú émí ɔ́, xomɛ sin i tlala.

Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, nǔ e gbeyíɖɔ Jelemíi kó ɖɔ ɖ'ayǐ ɔ́ jɛ; é wɛ nyí ɖɔ: "
"“A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.” ","“È se mɛɖé ɖo xó sú wɛ ɖo Lama, bɔ é ɖo avǐ ya wɛ, bó ɖo alě ná wɛ tlala; Hlacɛ́li wɛ ɖo vǐ tɔn lɛ́ɛ ví wɛ, bó jló ná se gbɔ ǎ, ɖó vǐ tɔn lɛ́ɛ sɔ́ ɖe ǎ.” "
"After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt ","Ée Elódu kú ɔ́, wɛnsagun Aklúnɔ tɔn ɖokpó wá xo dlɔ̌ Jozɛ́fu ɖo Ejípu, "
"and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child's life are dead.” ","bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Sí te; zě vǐ ɔ́, kplá nɔ tɔn, bó lɛ́ kɔ yi Izlayɛ́li; ɖó mɛ e ɖo vǐ ɔ́ ba ná hu wɛ lɛ́ɛ kó kú.” "
"So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, Jozɛ́fu sí te, bó zé vǐ ɔ́, bó kplá vǐ ɔ́ sín nɔ, bó lɛ́ kɔ yi Izlayɛ́li. "
"But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee, ","Lo ɔ́, ée é se ɖɔ Akelawúsi wɛ ɖo tɔ́ tɔn Elódu zinkpo jí, bó ɖo axɔ́sú ɖu wɛ ɖo Judée ɔ́, fínɛ́ yiyi dó xɛsi n'i; Mawu ka lɛ́ xo dlɔ̌ ɛ, bɔ é gbɔ bó yi Galilée yíkúngban jí, "
"and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets: “He will be called a Nazarene.”In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the Desert of Judea ","lobo yi cí to e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Nazalɛ́ti ɔ́ mɛ, bónú nǔ e gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ kó wlán ɔ́ ná dó jɛ, é wɛ nyí ɖɔ: “È nǎ ylɔ́ Mɛhwlɛ́ngántɔ́ ɔ́ ɖɔ Nazalɛ́tinu.”Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, Jǎan Yɛhwesinlɛnúmɛtɔ́ ɔ́ wá, bó ɖo Mawuxó jlá wɛ ɖo gbětótló mɛ ɖo Judée, "

"This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah: “A voice of one calling in the desert, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.’ ” ","Jǎan wɛ nyí mɛ e wú gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn Ezayíi ɖɔ xógbe élɔ́ dó é: “È se mɛɖé ɖo xó sú wɛ ɖo gbětótló mɛ, bó ɖo ɖiɖɔ wɛ ɖɔ: ‘Mi bló ali ɖó nú Aklúnɔ, mi jlɔ́ ali tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖó.’ ” "
"John's clothes were made of camel's hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. ","Awu kacakaca ɖé wɛ Jǎan nɔ dó, bɔ è sɔ́ lǎkúnmí sín fún dó lɔn ná, bɔ é nɔ́ sin gǒjíblánú e è sɔ́ anyǔ dó bló ná é. É nɔ ɖu wɛn kpódó wǐin akú kpó. "
People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan. ,"Jeluzalɛ́munu lɛ́ɛ, Judéenu lɛ́ɛ kpódó mɛ e ɖo to e ɖo Judɛ́ɛn tɔ kpá é mɛ lɛ́ɛ kpó nɔ́ yi gɔ̌n tɔn. "
"Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. ","Yě nɔ́ ɖɔ hwɛ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ, bɔ Jǎan nɔ lɛ yɛhwesin nú yě ɖo Judɛ́ɛn tɔ ɔ́ mɛ. "
"But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them: “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? ","Ée é mɔ Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ kpódó Saduseɛn lɛ́ɛ gěgé kpó wá yɛhwesin lɛ gbé ɔ́, é ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Jakpata kúnkan e mi! Mɛ̌ ka kplɔ́n mi ɖɔ mi ní hɔn nú xomɛsin Mawu tɔn e jǎwe ɔ́?” "
Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. ,Nǔwiwa mitɔn lɛ́ɛ ní bó ɖe xlɛ́ ɖɔ mi lɛ́ kɔ sín hwɛ mitɔn lɛ́ɛ gúdo nǔgbó. 
"And do not think you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.

"The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. ","Asyɔ́ví ɖíe ko ɖo atín lɛ́ɛ sín ɖɔ wú e: atín e ma nɔ ná sínsɛ́n ɖagbe ǎ ɔ́, è nǎ gbo e, bó bɛ́ kɔn nyi myɔ mɛ. "
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. ,"Hwe énɛ́ ɔ́ nu wɛ Jezu gosín Galilée yíkúngban jí, bó wá Jǎan gɔ́n ɖo Judɛ́ɛn tɔ ɔ́ nu, bónú Jǎan ná lɛ yɛhwesin n'i. "
"But John tried to deter him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” ","Jǎan ka gbɛ́, bó ɖɔ: “Nyi wɛ ɖó ná wá gɔ̌n towe, bɔ a nǎ lɛ yɛhwesin nú mì, bɔ hwɛ ka wá gɔ̌n ce a?” "
"Jesus replied, “Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness.” Then John consented. ","Jezu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Vɛ̌ gbɔ, ní to nyí mɔ̌ hwɛ̌; ɖó lě e mǐ sixú wa nǔ jlɔ́jlɔ́ gbɔn é nɛ́.” Énɛ́ ɔ́, Jǎan yí gbe. "
"As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him. ","Ée é lɛ yɛhwesin n'i fó ɔ́, Jezu tɔ́n sín tɔ ɔ́ mɛ; tlóló ɔ́, jǐnukúnsin kɛ wun, bɔ Yɛ Mawu tɔn cí ahwannɛ́ ɖɔhun, bó wá jɛ te dó jǐ tɔn. "
"And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil. ","Tlóló ɔ́, è se gbe ɖé sín jǐxwé bɔ é ɖɔ: “Vǐ ce vívɛ́ná wɛ mɛ élɔ́ nyí; xomɛ nɔ hun mì dó wǔtu tɔn tlala.”Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, Yɛ ɔ́ kplá Jezu yi gbětótló mɛ bónú awǒvi ná tɛ́n ɛ kpɔ́n. "
"After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. ","Jezu blá nu xɔ kéze kanɖé (40), zǎn kanɖé (40), énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, xovɛ́ wá sín i, "
"The tempter came to him and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.” ","bɔ mɛtɛ́nkpɔ́ntɔ́ ɔ́ sɛ yá ɛ, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Nú Mawu ví jɛ́n wɛ a nyǐ nǔgbó hǔn, ɖe gbe nú awǐnnya élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, nú yě ní húzú nǔɖuɖu.” "
"Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’ ” ","Jezu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “È ko wlán dó Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ɖɔ jí: ‘Nǔɖuɖu kɛ́ɖɛ́ wɛ gbɛtɔ́ nɔ́ ɖu bó nɔ́ nɔ gbɛ ǎ; lo ɔ́, xó e ko tɔ́n sín Mawu nu mɛ ɔ́ bǐ wɛ nɔ́ hɛn mɛ ɖó gbɛ.’ ” "
Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, awǒvi kplá Jezu yi Jeluzalɛ́mu, to mímɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ, bó sɔ́ ɛ ɖó sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́ ta aga ɖéé, "
"“If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down.

"Jesus answered him, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’ ” ",Jezu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Mɔ̌ jɛ́n wɛ è lɛ́ wlán ɖɔ jí: ‘Ma tɛ́n Aklúnɔ Mawu towe kpɔ́n ó.’ ” 
"Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor. ","Awǒvi lɛ́ kplá ɛ yi só ɖé jí; só ɔ́ yi jǐ ɖésú; é xlɛ́ ɛ axɔ́súɖuto gbɛmɛ fí tɔn lɛ́ɛ, kpódó dɔkun yětɔn lɛ́ɛ kpan, "

"Jesus said to him, “Away from me, Satan! For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.’ ” ","Jezu ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Satáan, bǔ dó mì! Ɖó è ko wlán dó Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ɖɔ jí: ‘Aklúnɔ Mawu towe wɛ a nǎ ɖe kɔ́ ná, lobo sɛn é ɖokpónɔ géé.’ ” "
"Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him. ","Awǒvi ka jó e dó bo yi; bɔ wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ wá Jezu gɔ́n, bo wá gɔ́ alɔ n'i. "
"When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he returned to Galilee. ","Ée Jezu se ɖɔ è wlǐ Jǎan dó gankpá mɛ ɔ́, é gosín fínɛ́, bo yi Galilée gbé jí. "
"Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali– ","Ée é gosín Nazalɛ́ti ɔ́, é yi cí Kafaanawúmu, to e ɖo Galilée xutó ɔ́ mɛ, ɖo Zabulɔ́ɔn kpódó Nɛfutali to kpan gbé jí. "

"“Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.” ","Jezu ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi xwedó mì; un ná ná kplɔ́n mi, bɔ mi ná nɔ dɔn gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, lě e mi nɔ nyi ɖɔ dó wlí hweví gbɔn é.” "
At once they left their nets and followed him. ,Yě ká jó ɖɔ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ dó tlóló bó xwedó e. 
"Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them, ","Jezu ná lɛ́ sɛ yi nukɔn kpɛɖé ɔ́, é mɔ Zebeɖée ví we, Jaki kpódó Jǎan kpó, bɔ yě kpódó tɔ́ yětɔn kpó ɖo akló mɛ, bo ɖo ɖɔ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ blóɖó wɛ. É ylɔ́ yě. "
and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him. ,"Azɔn ɖokpó ɔ́, yě jó akló ɔ́ kpódó tɔ́ yětɔn kpó dó, bó xwedó e. "
"Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. ","Jezu ka nɔ gbɔn Galilée gbé ɔ́ bǐ jí, bó nɔ́ ɖo nǔ kplɔ́n mɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ, gbɔn kplɔ́ngbasá Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn, bó nɔ́ ɖo axɔ́súɖuɖu Mawu tɔn sín Wɛn Ɖagbe jlá wɛ, lobo nɔ gbɔ azɔn alɔkpa alɔkpa lɛ́ɛ bǐ, kpódó wɔngblézɔn lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpó nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖo togun ɔ́ mɛ.

"News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed, and he healed them.

"Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and the region across the Jordan followed him.Now when he saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him, ","Ahwan wɔ̌buwɔ́bú ɖé lɛ́ɛ xwedó e; yě gosín Jeluzalɛ́mu, bó gosín Galilée gbé jí, bó gosín Judée gbé jí, lobo gosín tota wǒ lɛ́ɛ gbé jí kpódó to e ɖo Judɛ́ɛn tɔ ɔ́ gúdo lɛ́ɛ kpan mɛ.Ée Jezu mɔ ahwan gěgé énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, é xá só jí, bo jínjɔ́n ayǐ; ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ sɛ yá ɛ, "
and he began to teach them saying: ,bɔ é jɛ nǔ kplɔ́n yě jí ɖɔ:

"Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. ","Nǔ nyɔ́ nú mɛ e ɖo aluwɛ mɛ lɛ́ɛ, ɖó è nǎ dó gbɔ nú yě. "
"Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. ","Nǔ nyɔ́ nú mɛfífá lɛ́ɛ, ɖó ayǐkúngban ɔ́ na nyí yětɔn! "
"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. ","Nǔ nyɔ́ nú mɛ e nǔjlɔ́jlɔ́wiwa sín xovɛ́ nɔ sín, bɔ kɔ tɔn nɔ xú yě lɛ́ɛ é; ɖó yě ná gɔ́ xo. "

"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. ","Nǔ nyɔ́ nú ayimímɛ́nɔ lɛ́ɛ, ɖó yě ná mɔ Mawu. "
"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God. ","Nǔ nyɔ́ nú mɛ e nɔ jɛ tagba, nú fífá ná dó tíin lɛ́ɛ, ɖó è nǎ ylɔ́ yě ɖɔ Mawu ví. "

"Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. ","Mi j'awǎ, bó hun xomɛ, ɖó ajɔ ɖaxó ɖo te kpɔ́n mi ɖo sɛ́xwé. Ɖó, mɔ̌ wɛ è ko dó ya nú gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn e jɛ nukɔn nú mi lɛ́ɛ gbɔn ɔ́ nɛ́. "
"“You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men. ","“Jɛ wɛ mi nyí nú gbɛ ɔ́. Lo ɔ́, ényí jɛ ma ka sɔ́ ɖó tɔ́n ǎ ɔ́, étɛ́ wɛ è nǎ dó lɛ́ na ɛ tɔ́n na? É sɔ́ nyɔ́ nú nǔɖé zɛ è nǎ sɔ́ kɔn nyi gbě, bó ná gbídí kpó afɔ kpó wú ǎ. "
“You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. ,“Mi wɛ nyí wěziza nú gbɛ ɔ́
"Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. ","È ka nɔ ta zogbɛ́n bó nɔ́ sɔ́ dó zɛ̌n glɔ́ ǎ; lo ɔ́, nǔ ta aga wɛ è nɔ sɔ́ ɖó, bɔ é nɔ́ ɖi ɖɛ̌ nú mɛ e ɖo xwé gbe lɛ́ɛ bǐ ná mɔ nukúnnú. "
"In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven. ","Wěziza mitɔn ní bo hɔ́n ɖo gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ nukɔn, bónú yě ní mɔ nǔ ɖagbe wiwa mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ, bo na dó kpa susu nú Tɔ́ mitɔn e ɖo sɛ́xwé é. "
“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets,Fon
"I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. ","Ɖó ma ɖɔ nǔgbó nú mi: ényí jǐnukúnsin kpódó ayǐkúngban kpó ma ko vɔ ǎ ɔ́, wěkwín kpɛví títí ɖokpó géé ɖo sɛ́n lɛ́ɛ mɛ ná hwe sín wɛ káká cóbónú nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ná sɔgbe ǎ. "
"Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. ","Hǔn, mɛ e na gba sɛ́n kpɛví títí ɖokpó ɖo sɛ́n nɛ́ lɛ́ɛ mɛ, lobo ná lɛ́ kplɔ́n mɛɖěvo lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ yě lɔ ní bló gbɔn mɔ̌ ɔ́, mɛ énɛ́ ɔ́ ná sɔ atɛ́n ɖo axɔ́súɖuto sɛ́xwé tɔn mɛ ǎ.

"For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. ","Ɖó, ma ɖɔ nú mi: ényí nǔjlɔ́jlɔ́wiwa mitɔn ma hú gǎn sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpódó Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ kpó tɔn ǎ ɔ́, mi ɖo axɔ́súɖuto sɛ́xwé tɔn mɛ na byɔ́ wɛ ǎ. "
"“You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘Do not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’ ","“Mi se bɔ è ko ɖɔ nú tɔ́gbó mitɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: ‘Ma hu mɛ ó; ényí mɛɖé hu mɛ ɔ́, è nǎ ɖó hwɛ n'i.’ "
"But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, ‘Raca, ’ is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of hell. ","Lo ɔ́, nyɛ ka ɖo ɖiɖɔ nú mi wɛ ɖɔ: mɛ ɖěbǔ sin xomɛ dó nɔzo tɔn ɔ́, é jɛ xá ɖɔ è nǐ ɖɔ hwɛ xá mɛ énɛ́; mɛ e ka na zun nɔzo tɔn ɖɔ: ‘Nǔvɔ́nɔ’ ɔ́, é jɛ xá ɖɔ toxóɖɔgbɛ́ ɔ́ ní dɔn tó n'i.

"“Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, ","Hǔn, ényí a wǎ vɔ̌sákpe nukɔn, bó ja nǔɖé xwlé Mawu gbé, bó flín ɖɔ hwɛgbe ɖé ɖo nɔzo émítɔn kpódó émí kpó tɛ́ntin hǔn, "
leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother,Fon
"“Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still with him on the way, or he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. ","“Ényí a wa nǔ nyi do nú nɔzo towe ɖé, bónú é kplá we xwe hwɛ nukɔn hǔn, yǎ wǔ dó hwɛ gbɔ xá ɛ hwenu e hwi kpódó é kpó ɖo ali jí ɔ́, é ma nyí mɔ̌ ǎ ɔ́, é ná kplá we dó así nú hwɛɖɔtɔ́, bɔ hwɛɖɔtɔ́ ná jó we nú gantɔ́cɔ́tɔ́, bɔ éyɛ́ ná sɔ́ we dó gankpá mɛ.

"“You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’ ",“Mi ka se ɖɔ: ‘Ma lɛ aga ó.’ 
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. ,"Lo ɔ́, nyɛ ɖo ɖiɖɔ nú mi wɛ ɖɔ: mɛɖé kpɔ́n nyɔ̌nu ɖé bó ɖo linlin wɛ ná ɖó xó xá ɛ ɔ́, é ko lɛ aga xá nyɔ̌nu énɛ́ ɖo ayi mɛ xóxó. "
"If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. ","Ényí nukún towe ɖisíxwé tɔn ɔ́ na dɔn we dó nǔ nyanya mɛ hǔn, ɖe síin, bo sɔ́ nyi gbě; ɖó ényí a gbɔ bónú nǔɖé hwe ɖo wútu towe ɔ́, é nyɔ́ nú we hú nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ní sɔgbe ɖo wǔtu towe bɔ è nǎ sɔ́ hwi ɖésúnɔ ɔ́ bǐ nyi dó zojimací mɛ.

"And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.

"“It has been said, ‘Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.’ ","“È ka lɛ́ ɖɔ: ‘Mɛ ɖé gbɛ́ asi tɔn hǔn, ní wlán wěma dó así n'i ɖɔ émí gbɛ́ ɛ.’ "
"But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery. ","Lo ɔ́, nyɛ ɖo ɖiɖɔ nú mi wɛ ɖɔ: mɛɖé nya asi tɔn, bɔ é ma nyí ɖɔ afɔ wɛ é dó gbě ǎ ɔ́, aga wɛ é ɖɔ é ní yi lɛ. Mɛ e ka da nyɔ̌nu e asú tɔn gbɛ́ ɛ ɔ́, é lɔmɔ̌ nyí agalɛtɔ́. "

"But I tell you, Do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; ","Lo ɔ́, nyɛ ɖo ɖiɖɔ nú mi wɛ ɖɔ: mi ma xwlé nǔ ɖěbǔ ó, mi ma xwlé jǐnukúnsin ó, ɖó é wɛ nyí axɔ́súzinkpo Mawu tɔn. "
"or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. ","Mi ma ka xwlé ayǐkúngban ó, ɖó é wɛ nyí afɔɖótɛn Mawu tɔn; mi ma xwlé Jeluzalɛ́mu ó, ɖó é wɛ nyí axɔ́sú ɖaxó ɔ́ sín to. "
"And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. ","Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, ma xwlé ta towe ó, ɖó a sixú bló bɔ ɖa e ɖo ta towe ɔ́ kwín ɖokpó géé ná húzú wěwé abǐ wiwi ǎ. "
"Simply let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your ‘No,’ ‘No’; anything beyond this comes from the evil one. ","Ényí xó mitɔn nyí ‘ɛɛn’ hǔn, ní nyí ‘ɛɛn’, é ka nyí ‘éeǒ’ hǔn, ní nyí ‘éeǒ’. Nǔ e mi nɔ xwlé d'é jí ɔ́ bǐ ɔ́, awǒvi gɔ́n wɛ é gosín. "

"And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. ","Ényí mɛɖé jló ná ylɔ́ hwɛ we, bo na yí awu towe do tɔn ɔ́ hǔn, lɛ̌ jó awu towe ɖaxó ɔ́ dó n'i d'é jí. "

"“You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ ","“Mi se ɖɔ: ‘Yǐ wǎn nú nɔzo towe, bó gbɛ́ wǎn nú kɛntɔ́ towe.’ "
"But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, ","Lo ɔ́, nyɛ ɖo ɖiɖɔ nú mi wɛ ɖɔ: mi yí wǎn nú kɛntɔ́ mitɔn lɛ́ɛ. Mi xo ɖɛ dó mɛ e nɔ dó nu mi lɛ́ɛ jí. Mi wa ɖagbe nú mɛ e nɔ gbɛ́ wǎn nú mi lɛ́ɛ, bó xo ɖɛ ɖagbe nú mɛ e nɔ ɖe dó mi bó nɔ́ dó ya nú mi lɛ́ɛ. "
"that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.

"Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.“Be careful not to do your ‘acts of righteousness’ before men, to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.

"But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. ","Lo ɔ́, mi kplé dɔkun mitɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖó sɛ́xwé; ɖó nǔvínúví nɔ́ ɖu nǔ ɖo fínɛ́ ǎ; nǔ nɔ́ jɛ ko ɖo fínɛ́ ǎ; ajotɔ́ ka nɔ́ tɔ́n dǒ, bó nɔ́ fin nǔ ɖo fínɛ́ ǎ. "
"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. ","Ɖó fí ɖěe dɔkun towe ɖe ɔ́, fínɛ́ wɛ ayi towe lɔmɔ̌ ná nɔ.” "
"“The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light. ","“Nukún towe lɛ́ɛ wɛ nyí zogbɛ́n nú agbaza towe; ényí nukún towe lɛ́ɛ ɖo ganjí ɔ́, agbaza towe bǐ ná nɔ wěziza mɛ. "
"But if your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness! ","Lo ɔ́, ényí nukún towe lɛ́ɛ ma ɖo ganjí ǎ ɔ́, agbaza towe bǐ ná nɔ zǐnflú mɛ; ɖó nú wěziza e ɖo wútu towe ɔ́ húzú zǐnflú ɔ́, zǐnflú gɔngɔn tɛ́ mɛ wɛ a ka na ɖe nɛ́?” "
"“No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money. ","“Mɛ ɖé sixú sɛn gǎn we ǎ; ɖó é ná gbɛ́ wǎn nú mɛ ɖě, bo na yí wǎn nú mɛ ɖě; abǐ é ná se tónú nú mɛ ɖě, bo na vɛ́ tóli nú mɛ ɖě. Mi sixú sɛn Mawu bo lɛ́ sɛn dɔkun ǎ.” "
"“Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? ","“Énɛ́ wú ɔ́, má ɖɔ nú mi: ado ní ma hu mi dó nǔ e mi na ɖu, bo na nɔ gbɛ é, kpódó nǔ e mi na dó é kpó wú ó; gbɛ ma xɔ akwɛ́ hú nǔɖuɖu, bɔ agbaza lɔ ma xɔ akwɛ́ hú nǔzínzán ǎ cé? "
"Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? ","Mi kpɔ́n xɛ lɛ́ɛ; yě nɔ dó nǔkún ǎ, yě ká nɔ ya nǔkún bó nɔ́ bɛ́ dó agɔ̌ mɛ ǎ; có Tɔ́ mitɔn e ɖo sɛ́xwé ɔ́ ka nɔ́ ná nǔɖuɖu yě. Midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mi ma ka xɔ akwɛ́ hú xɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ǎ cé? "
Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? ,"Mɛ̌ ka ɖo mi mɛ, bɔ nǔlinkpɔ́n tɔn ná zɔ́n, bɔ é ná sixú dó azǎn kpɛɖé gbɛzán é ɖésú tɔn jí? "
“And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. ,"“Étɛ́wútu mi ka nɔ ɖo tagba jɛ dó nǔ e mi ná dó ɔ́ wú wɛ? Mi kpɔ́n lě e folówa lɛ́ɛ nɔ su gbɔn ɖo gběhan lɛ́ɛ mɛ é; yě nɔ wa azɔ̌ ɖě ǎ, yě ká nɔ lɔn avɔ ǎ. "
Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. ,"Axɔ́sú Salomɔ́ɔ ɖésú ɔ́, lě e é ɖó dɔkun sɔ ɔ́ nɛ́, có é ma ka ɖó avɔ sɔ ɖokpó yětɔn nɛ́! "
"If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? ","Ényí Mawu ka ba acɔ́ nú gběhan e ɖo te égbé, bɔ sɔ ɔ́, è nǎ bɛ̌ dó myɔ mɛ ɔ́ sɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, nɛ̌ wɛ é ma ka ná ná mi nǔ e mi ná dó lɛ́ɛ ǎ gbɔn, nǔɖiɖi kpɛvínɔ e mi? "
"So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ ","Hǔn, mi bo ma jɛ tagba, bó nɔ́ ɖɔ: ‘Ani mǐ ka ná ɖu’; ‘ani mǐ ka ná nu’; ‘étɛ́ mǐ ka ná dó’ ó. "
"For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. ","Ɖó mɛ e ma ɖi nǔ nú Mawu ǎ lɛ́ɛ wɛ nɔ́ ɖo wezun dó wɛ, ɖo nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ gúdo. Tɔ́ mǐtɔn e ɖo sɛ́xwé ɔ́ tunwun ɖɔ nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ hu dó mi. "
"But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. ","Axɔ́súɖuɖu Mawu tɔn kpódó jlǒ tɔn wiwa kpó ní nɔ́ myá nukún nú mi jɛ nukɔn; énɛ́ ɔ́, é ná ná nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ mi. "
"Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.“Do not judge, or you too will be judged. ","Mi ma lin sɔ e ja ɔ́ kpɔ́n ó, ɖó sɔ e ja ɔ́ ná wá kpódó tagba é ɖésúnɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó.

"For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. ","Ɖó lě e mi nɔ ɖɔ hwɛ xá mɛ gbɔn ɔ́, mɔ̌ wɛ Mawu na ɖɔ hwɛ xá mi lɔmɔ̌ gbɔn. Nǔ e mi sɔ́ dó jlɛ́ nǔ nú mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ ɔ́ wɛ Mawu ná sɔ́ dó jlɛ́ nǔ nú mi lɔmɔ̌. "
“Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? ,"Étɛ́wú a ka ɖo nǔywɛ́ e ɖo nukún jí nú nɔví towe ɔ́ kpɔ́n wɛ, bó má ka mɔ atínkpo e ɖo nukún towe jí ɔ́ ǎ? "

"“Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and then turn and tear you to pieces.

"Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? ","Abǐ, nú vǐ tɔn byɔ́ ɛ hweví ɔ́, é ná ná ɛ dan? "
"If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him! ","Midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, lě e mi dá sɔ ɔ́ nɛ́, có mi ka tunwun nǔ ɖagbe bo nɔ ná vǐ mitɔn lɛ́ɛ. Nɛ̌ wɛ Tɔ́ mitɔn e ɖo sɛ́xwé ɔ́ ma ka ná ná nǔ ɖagbe mɛ e byɔ́ ɛ lɛ́ɛ ǎ gbɔn? "

"Likewise every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. ","Atín ɖagbe ɔ́, sínsɛ́n ɖagbe wɛ é nɔ́ ná, bɔ atín nyanya nɔ ná sínsɛ́n nyanya. "
"A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. ",Atín ɖagbe ɖé sixú ná sínsɛ́n nyanya ǎ
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. ,"Atín ɖěbǔ ma ná sínsɛ́n ɖagbe ǎ ɔ́, è nɔ gbo e, bo nɔ sɔ́ nyi myɔ mɛ. "
"Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them. ","Hǔn, nǔwiwa yětɔn wɛ ná zɔ́n bɔ mi na dó tunwun nǔ e yě nyí ɔ́. "
"“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.

"The centurion replied, “Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. ","Sɔ́ja kanwekogán ɔ́ ka yí xó bó ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ, un nyí mɛ bónú a nǎ xwedó mì yi xwé cé gbe ǎ. Vɛ̌ ko ɖe gbe kpowun, énɛ́ ɔ́, azɔn ná gbɔ nú mɛsɛntɔ́ ce. "
"For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes.

"“He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives the one who sent me. ","“Mɛ e yí mi ɔ́, nyɛ wɛ é yí; mɛ e ka yí nyɛ ɔ́, mɛ e sɛ́ mì dó ɔ́ wɛ é yí. "
"Anyone who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and anyone who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward.

"And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is my disciple, I tell you the truth, he will certainly not lose his reward.”After Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee. ","Bɔ mɛ ɖěbǔ ka ná sin fífá kɔ́fu ɖokpó kpowun yɔkpɔ́vú lěhunkɔtɔn, ɖó é nyí ahwanvú ce wútu ɔ́, má ɖɔ nǔgbó nú mi, é ná ba ajɔ tɔn kpo ǎ.”Ée Jezu kplɔ́n nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ahwanvú tɔn wěwe lɛ́ɛ fó ɔ́, é gosín fínɛ́, bó ɖidó toxo e ɖo gbě ɔ́ jí fínɛ́ lɛ́ɛ mɛ, lobo ná jlá Mawuxó yě.

"When John heard in prison what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples ","Ée Jǎan ɖo gankpá mɛ, bó se azɔ̌ e wa wɛ Klísu ɖe lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, é sɛ́ ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ dó e, "

"Jesus replied, “Go back and report to John what you hear and see: ",Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě bó ɖɔ: “Mi yi ɖɔ nǔ e se wɛ mi ɖe lɛ́ɛ kpódó nǔ e mɔ wɛ mi ɖe lɛ́ɛ kpó nú Jǎan. 
"The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.

Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me.” ,Nǔ nyɔ́ nú mɛ e sín nǔɖiɖi ma ná jɛ ayǐ ɖó nyɛ wú ǎ lɛ́ɛ.” 
"As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: “What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind? ","Ée wɛnsagun Jǎan tɔn lɛ́ɛ lɛ́ kɔ ɖidó ɔ́, Jezu jɛ Jǎan xó ɖɔ nú togun ɔ́ jí ɖɔ: “Ani wɛ mi ka yi kpɔ́n ɖo gbětótló mɛ? Fántín ɖé wɛ mi mɔ bɔ jɔhɔn ɖo dǐndán wɛ a? Éeǒ! "
"If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are in kings' palaces. ","Ani mi ka yi mɔ? Mɛ ɖé wɛ mi mɔ, bɔ é dó awu xɔ akwɛ́ a? Mɛ e ka nɔ dó akwɛ́nɔwu lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, axɔ́sú lɛ́ɛ sín xwé gbe wɛ yě nɔ́ nɔ. "
"Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. ",Étɛ́ kpɔ́n gbé wɛ mi ka yi? Gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn ɖé wɛ a? Ɛɛn wɛ un ɖɔ nú mi

I tell you the truth: Among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist,Fon
"From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful men lay hold of it. ","Sín Jǎan Yɛhwesinlɛnúmɛtɔ́ ɔ́ hwenu káká wá jɛ din ɔ́, axɔ́súɖuto sɛ́xwé tɔn ɔ́, hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n nú wɛ é nyí, bɔ mɛ e dó gǎn ɖésú lɛ́ɛ wɛ nɔ́ ba ná klá jɛ nu. "

"And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come. ","Bónú mi ná dó mɔ nǔ jɛ xó e ɖɔ wɛ un ɖe ɔ́ wú ɔ́, mi bo tunwun ɖɔ Jǎan wɛ nyí Elíi e ɖó ná wá bɔ è ɖɔ é. "
"He who has ears, let him hear. ","Mɛ e ɖó tó, bó ná dó se nǔ ná ɔ́ ní ɖótó, bó se. "
“To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others: ,“Mɛ̌ wú wɛ un ka sigǎn jlɛ́ gbɛtɔ́ din tɔn lɛ́ɛ dó? Yě cí yɔkpɔ́vú e nɔ jínjɔ́n tokplétɛn bó nɔ́ ɖo xó sú sɛ́ dó gbɛ̌ yětɔn ɖě lɛ́ɛ wɛ ɔ́ ɖɔhun.

"For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’ ","Ɖó Jǎan wá, bó nɔ́ ɖu nǔ ǎ; é ka nɔ́ nu vɛ̌ɛn ǎ; bɔ è ɖɔ: ‘Yɛ nyanya wɛ ɖo jǐ tɔn.’ "
"The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and “sinners.” ’ But wisdom is proved right by her actions.” ","Nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ ka wá bó nɔ́ ɖu nǔ, bó nɔ́ nu vɛ̌ɛn, bɔ è ɖɔ: ‘Nya élɔ́ ɔ́, adɔtɔ́nɔ wɛ; vɛ̌ɛnnutɔ́ wɛ; tokwɛ́yítɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpódó hwɛhutɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpó sín xɔ́ntɔn wɛ.’ Lo ɔ́, nǔnywɛ́ Mawu tɔn ɖe hwɛjijɔ é ɖésúnɔ tɔn xlɛ́ gbɔn nǔwiwa tɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ.” "
"Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent. ","Ée Jezu ɖɔ xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ vɔ ɔ́, é jɛ hwɛ dó mɛ e sín tomɛ é jlɛ́ nǔ gěgé ɖe lɛ́ɛ jí, ɖó yě lɛ́ kɔ sín hwɛ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ gúdo ǎ wútu. "
"“Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. ","É ɖɔ: “Heelú mi, Kolazíinnu e mi! Heelú mi, Bɛtisayidanu e mi!

"But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ un ɖo ɖiɖɔ nú mi wɛ ɖɔ: hwɛɖɔzán gbe ɔ́, tó e è nǎ dɔn nú Tilunu lɛ́ɛ kpódó Sidɔ́ɔnnu lɛ́ɛ kpó ɔ́ ná bɔwǔ hú ée è nǎ dɔn nú mi e. "
"And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the skies? No, you will go down to the depths. If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day. ","Kafaanawúmu, hwɛ ɔ́ ka lo? È nǎ sɔ́ we yi jǐ káká yi sɔ́ jǐnukúnsin wɛ a vɛdó a?

But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.” ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ un ɖo ɖiɖɔ nú we wɛ ɖɔ: hwɛɖɔzán gbe ɔ́, tó e è nǎ dɔn nú Sodɔ́muto ɔ́ ná bɔwǔ hú ée è nǎ dɔn nú we ɔ́.” "
"At that time Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. ","Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, Jezu yí xó, bó ɖɔ: “Daá!

"Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure. ","Mɔ̌ wɛ, Daá! Ɖó lě e a jlǒ gbɔn é nɛ́. "
"“All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. ","“Nǔ bǐ wɛ Tɔ́ ce sɔ́ dó alɔ ce mɛ, bɔ mɛ ɖěbǔ ka mɔ nǔ jɛ Vǐ ɔ́ wú, zɛ Tɔ́ ɔ́ wú ǎ; mɛ ɖěbǔ ka lɛ́ mɔ nǔ jɛ Tɔ́ ɔ́ wú, zɛ Vǐ ɔ́ kpódó mɛ e Vǐ ɔ́ jló ná ɖe e xlɛ́ lɛ́ɛ kpó wú ǎ. "
"“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. ","“Mi wá gɔ̌n ce; mi mɛ e agban kpinkpɛn hinhɛn cikɔ ná lɛ́ɛ é bǐ, bónú ma ná gbɔjɛ́ mi.” "
"Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. ","Mi yí nǔkplɔ́nmɛ ce lɛ́ɛ se, bónú lǐndɔ̌n mitɔn lɛ́ɛ ná vo, ɖó mɛ fífá wɛ un nyí, bó nyí xomɛnyɔ́tɔ́. "
For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them. ,"Ɖó nǔkplɔ́nmɛ ce lɛ́ɛ vɛ́ wǔ ǎ, su ce lɛ́ɛ ka vɛ́ nyi ǎ.Ée Jezu ɖɔ xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ, bɔ é ná nɔ zaan ɔ́, é kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó wá ɖo ali ɖé jí gbɔn dín wɛ, ɖo jinukúngle ɖé mɛ, ɖo gbɔjɛzán Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn gbe.

"When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.” ","Ée Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ mɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě ɖɔ nú Jezu ɖɔ jí: “Kpɔ́n ahwanvú towe lɛ́ɛ ɖo nǔ e Mɔyízisɛ́n ɔ́ gbɛ́ ɖɔ è ma wa gbɔjɛzán gbe ó é wa wɛ.” "
"He answered, “Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? ","Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ jí: “Nǔ e Davídi wa hwenu e xovɛ́ sin é kpódó mɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó ɔ́, mi xá kpɔ́n ǎ cé? "
"He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread–which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests. ","É byɔ́ sinsɛnxɔ mɛ, bɔ é kpódó mɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó ɖu nǔɖuɖu e è sɔ́ xwlé Mawu é; ɖo sɛ́n mǐtɔn mɛ ɔ́, yě ká ɖó ná ɖu ǎ; vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kɛ́ɖɛ́ jɛ́n wɛ ɖó ná ɖu. "
Or haven't you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple desecrate the day and yet are innocent? ,"Abǐ, mi ma xa ɖo sɛ́nwéma ɔ́ mɛ ɖɔ gbɔjɛzán gbe ɔ́, vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ e jí azɔ̌ ɖe ɖo sinsɛnxɔ mɛ lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ gba gbɔjɛzánsɛ́n ɔ́, cóbɔ é nɔ́ gɔn hwɛ nyí nú yě ǎ cé? "
I tell you that one greater than the temple is here. ,"Má ɖɔ nú mi, nǔ hú gǎn sinsɛnxɔ wɛ ɖo fí. "
"If you had known what these words mean, ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the innocent. ","Nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ è ɖe bo ɖɔ: ‘Nǔbláwǔkúnúmɛ ba wɛ un ɖe; vɔ̌sísá ba wɛ un ɖe ǎ’ ɔ́, ényí ɖɔ mi ko mɔ nukúnnú jɛ xógbe énɛ́ wú wɛ ɔ́, mi sɔ́ ná ɖo hwɛ dó xomɛvɔ́nɔ lɛ́ɛ wɛ ǎ; "
For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.” ,ɖó nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ wɛ kpa acɛ nú gbɔjɛzán ɔ́.” 
"Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue, ","Ée Jezu gosín fínɛ́ ɔ́, é yi kplɔ́ngbasá yětɔn. "
"and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, they asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?” ","Nya ɖé ka ɖo fínɛ́, bɔ alɔ tɔn ɖokpó kú.

"He said to them, “If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out? ","Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌ ka ɖo mi mɛ, bónú gbɔ̌ ɖokpó e ɖo así tɔn ɔ́ jɛ dó mɛ gbɔjɛzán gbe ɔ́, é ma ná yi ɖe tɔ́n ǎ; "
How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.” ,"gbɛtɔ́ ka xɔ akwɛ́ hú gbɔ̌. Ényí mɔ̌ hǔn, ɖo sɛ́n mǐtɔn mɛ ɔ́, è hɛn ɔ́, è nǎ wa ɖagbe gbɔjɛzán gbe.” "
"Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other. ","Ée é ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, é ɖɔ nú nya ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Dlɛ̌n alɔ towe,” bɔ nya ɔ́ dlɛ́n alɔ, bɔ alɔ jɛ alɔ tɛn mɛ, bó cí wegɔ́ ɔ́ ɖɔhun, "
But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus. ,"bɔ Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ tɔ́n, bó yi kpá dó lě e yě ná hu Jezu gbɔn ɔ́ wú. "
"Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick, ","Ée Jezu tunwun ɖɔ yě blá gbě émítɔn ɔ́, é gosín fí e é ɖe ɔ́; mɛ lɛ́ɛ ka nyi ahwan xwedó e, bɔ é gbɔ azɔn nú azinzɔnnɔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ. "
warning them not to tell who he was. ,"Lo ɔ́, é dó sɛ́n nú yě syɛ́nsyɛ́n ɖɔ yě ní ma yi ɖɔ mɛ e émí nyí ɔ́ nú mɛɖé ó. "
This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: ,"Nǔ nyí mɔ̌, bónú nǔ e è ko ɖɔ ɖ'ayǐ gbɔn gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn Ezayíi jí ɔ́ ná dó jɛ; é wɛ nyí ɖɔ: "
"“Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations. ","“Mɛsɛntɔ́ ce e un sɔ́ ɔ́ ɖíe.

He will not quarrel or cry out,Fon
"A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, till he leads justice to victory. ",É ná nyínyɛ́ fántín e ko tɔ é ǎ
In his name the nations will put their hope.” ,Bɔ akɔta lɛ́ɛ bǐ na ɖó nukún i.” 
"Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see. ","È kplá yɛnyanyanɔ ɖé wá nú Jezu. Nya énɛ́ nɔ́ mɔ nukúnnú ǎ, é ka nɔ́ ɖɔ xó ǎ; Jezu ka gbɔ azɔn n'i, bɔ é jɛ nǔ mɔ jí, bó jɛ xó ɖɔ jí. "
"All the people were astonished and said, “Could this be the Son of David?” ","Nǔ énɛ́ kpácá ahwan ɔ́ tlala, bɔ yě ɖɔ: “Davídi ví ɔ́ nɛ́ ǎ cé?” "
"But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “It is only by Beelzebub, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.” ","Ée Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ se xó énɛ́ ɔ́, yě ɖɔ jí: “Nya élɔ́ ɔ́, Bɛluzebúlu yɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ xɔ́sú sín hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n wɛ é nɔ dó nya yɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ ná.” "
"Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. ","Ée Jezu ka mɔ nǔ jɛ ayi yětɔn mɛ ɔ́, é ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Axɔ́sú ɖé sín to ma ɖó gbe kpɔ́ ǎ ɔ́, to énɛ́ ɔ́ gba wɛ é nɔ́ gba; bɔ to abǐ xwé ɖé tíin bónú mɛ e ɖ'é mɛ lɛ́ɛ sín gbe ma ɖo kpɔ́ ǎ ɔ́, to énɛ́ ɔ́, abǐ xwé énɛ́ ɔ́ gba wɛ é nɔ́ gba.

"If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand? ","Ényí Satáan ka ɖo nǔ e nyí é ɖésúnɔ tɔn ɔ́ nya wɛ ɔ́, ahwan tɔ́n éɖée wɛ é ɖe nɛ́; nɛ̌ wɛ axɔ́súɖuto tɔn ka sixú nɔ te gbɔn? "
"And if I drive out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. ","Ényí ɖɔ yɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ xɔ́sú Bɛluzebúlu sín hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n wɛ nyɛ nɔ sɔ́ dó nya yɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ ná ɔ́, mɛ̌ sín hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n wɛ ahwanvú mitɔn lɛ́ɛ ka nɔ dó nya yě ná lo?

"But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. ","Lo ɔ́, é nyí ɖɔ Yɛ Mawu tɔn wɛ un nɔ dó nya yɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ ná ɔ́, hǔn mi bo tunwun ɖɔ axɔ́súɖuɖu Mawu tɔn ko wá mi mɛ. "
"“Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can rob his house. ","“Mɛ ɖé sixú byɔ́ súnnu glegbenu ɖé xwé, bó ná fɔ nǔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ ma to blá ɛ hwɛ̌ ǎ. Lo ɔ́, ényí é blá ɛ ɔ́, é ná fɔ nǔ e ɖo xwé tɔn gbe lɛ́ɛ. "
"“He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters. ","“Mɛ e ma ɖo ahwan ce mɛ ǎ ɔ́, mɛ énɛ́ mɔ mì gbɔ ǎ; bɔ mɛ e ma ka nɔ dɔn gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ wá gɔ̌n ce ǎ ɔ́, gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ nya dó zɔ nú mì wɛ é ɖe. "
"And so I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.

"“Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit. ","“Atín ɖagbe ɔ́, sínsɛ́n ɖagbe wɛ é nɔ́ ná, bɔ atín nyanya nɔ ná sínsɛ́n nyanya; ɖó sínsɛ́n atín tɔn wɛ è nɔ kpɔ́n, bó nɔ́ dó tunwun atín alɔkpa e é nyí é. "
"You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks. ",Jakpata kúnkan e mi! Nɛ̌ wɛ mi mɛ e nylá sɔ mɔ̌ lɛ́ɛ ná sixú ɖɔ nǔ ɖagbe gbɔn? Ɖó nǔ e gɔ́ ayi mɛtɔn mɛ ɔ́ wɛ nu mɛtɔn nɔ ɖɔ.

But I tell you that men will have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken. ,"Má ɖɔ nú mi: hwɛɖɔzán gbe wá su ɔ́, xó gbló e tɔ́n sín gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ nu mɛ ɔ́ bǐ sín gbe wɛ yě ná ɖó. "

For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.”That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake. ,"ɖó mɛ ɖěbǔ bló Tɔ́ ce e ɖo sɛ́xwé ɔ́ sín jlǒ ɔ́, mɛ énɛ́ wɛ nyí nɔví ce súnnu, bó nyí nɔví ce nyɔ̌nu, bó nyí nɔ ce.”Gbe nɛ́ gbe ɖokpó ɔ́, Jezu tɔ́n sín xwé gbe, bó yi jínjɔ́n xutó, bó ná kplɔ́n nǔ mɛ.

"As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. ","Hwenu e é ɖo nǔkún ɔ́ hú gbɔn gle ɔ́ mɛ wɛ ɔ́, ɖě jɛ ali jí, bɔ xɛ lɛ́ɛ wá cyán ɖu; "
"Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. ","ɖě yi jɛ awǐnnyakan mɛ fí e kɔ́ gěgé ɖé ma ɖe ǎ é; énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ yá wǔ wú, ɖó kɔ sukpɔ́ ɖo fínɛ́ ǎ; "

"Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. ","Ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ jɛ wundonu, bɔ wun lɛ́ɛ wú, bó vun blá yě. "
"Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop–a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.

"He who has ears, let him hear.” ","Bó ná dó sú ta ná ɔ́, Jezu ɖɔ: “Mɛ e ɖó tó bó ná dó se nǔ ná ɔ́ ní ɖótó bó se.” "
"The disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?” ","Ahwanvú Jezu tɔn lɛ́ɛ sɛ yá ɛ, bó kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Aniwútu wɛ a ka nɔ dó lǒ dó ɖɔ xó nú yě?” "
"He replied, “The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. ","Jezu yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Axɔ́súɖuɖu sɛ́xwé tɔn sín nǔbúdo lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ è hun xlɛ́; è ka xlɛ́ yědɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ǎ. "

"This is why I speak to them in parables: “Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand. ","Nǔ e wú un nɔ dó lǒ dó ɖɔ xó nú yě ɔ́ nɛ́; ɖó yě ɖo nǔ mɔ wɛ, cóbó nyí mamɔtɔ́; yě ɖo nǔ se wɛ, cóbó nyí masetɔ́; yě ká nɔ lɛ́ mɔ nukúnnú jɛ nǔ ɖěbǔ mɛ ǎ. "
In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: “ ‘You will be ever hearing but never understanding,Fon
"For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.’ ","Ɖó togun élɔ́ sín ayixa ko syɛ́n; yě sú tó yětɔn, bó myɔ́ nukún, ɖó nukún yětɔn táá wá mɔ nǔ, bónú tó yětɔn táá wá se nǔ, nú ayixa yětɔn ná wá ja nǔ mɔ jɛ nǔ mɛ gbé, bónú yě ná wá ja kɔ lɛ́ sín hwɛ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ gúdo gbé, nú ma wá gbɔ azɔn nú yě.

"But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. ","“Amɔ̌, midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, nǔ nyɔ́ nú mi, ɖó nukún mitɔn lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ mɔ nǔ, bɔ tó mitɔn lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ se nǔ. "
"For I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.

“Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: ,"“Midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mi bo ɖótó lǒ e un dó nú yě dó nǔkúndótɔ́ wú ɔ́ sín tínmɛ. "
"When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path. ","Ayǐkúngban e jí nǔkún lɛ́ɛ jɛ ɖo alixo ɔ́ wɛ nyí mɛ e se axɔ́súɖuɖu Mawu tɔn sín xó, bó ma mɔ nukúnnú jɛ wú ǎ é; awǒvi nɔ́ wá ɖe ée é se ɔ́ sín ayi tɔn mɛ. "
The one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. ,"Awǐnnyakan mɛ fí e nǔkún ɖě lɛ́ɛ yi jɛ, bó wú tlóló ɔ́ wɛ nyí mɛ e se axɔ́súɖuɖu Mawu tɔn sín xó, bó yí dó ayi mɛ tlóló kpódó awǎjijɛ kpó é; "
"But since he has no root, he lasts only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away. ","lo ɔ́, é ka dó ɖɔ do ǎ; é syɛ́nlǐn ǎ, bɔ hwenu e è nɔ wá ɖo tagba dó nú mɛ wɛ, abǐ è nɔ ɖo mɛ ɖe dó wɛ ɖó Mawuxó ɔ́ wútu ɔ́, nǔɖiɖi tɔn nɔ́ jɛ ayǐ. "
"The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful. ","Ayǐkúngban e jí nǔkún lɛ́ɛ jɛ ɖo wundonu ɔ́ wɛ nyí mɛ e nɔ se axɔ́súɖuɖu Mawu tɔn sín xó, bɔ gbɛmɛ fí sín tagba lɛ́ɛ, dɔkun gbɛmɛ fí tɔn sín mɛdindɔn lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ vun blá xó ɔ́, bɔ é má nɔ́ sixú ná sínsɛ́n ǎ é.

"But the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it. He produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.” ","Ayǐkúngban ɖagbe e jí nǔkún lɛ́ɛ jɛ, bó ná sínsɛ́n gěgé ɔ́ wɛ nyí mɛ e se axɔ́súɖuɖu Mawu tɔn sín xó, bó mɔ nǔ jɛ mɛ é.

Jesus told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. ,Jezu lɛ́ dó lǒ ɖěvo nú yě bó ɖɔ: “Axɔ́súɖuto sɛ́xwé tɔn cí nya e dó jinukún ɖagbe kɛ́ɖɛ́ dó gle tɔn mɛ ɔ́ ɖɔhun
"But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. ","hwenu e mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɖo amlɔ dɔ́ wɛ zǎn mɛ ɔ́, kɛntɔ́ tɔn wá dó gběhan nyanya kɔn nyi gle tɔn mɛ bó yi. "
"When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared. ","Hwenu e jinukún lɛ́ɛ su, bó jɛ sínsɛ́n jí ɔ́, è wǎ mɔ nukúnnú jɛ gběhan nyanya lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌ wú. "
"“The owner's servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’ ","Xwétɔ́ ɔ́ sín mɛsɛntɔ́ lɛ́ɛ wá ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: ‘Aklúnɔ, é ma ka nyí jinukún ɖagbe kɛ́ɖɛ́ wɛ a dǒ nyi gle towe mɛ ǎ cé? Fítɛ́ gběhan nyanya ka gosín, bó wá tɔ́n ɖ'é mɛ?’ "
"“ ‘An enemy did this,’ he replied. “The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’ ",É ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: ‘Kɛntɔ́ sín nǔwiwa wɛ.’ Mɛsɛntɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ ka kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: ‘A jlǒ ɖɔ mǐ ní hɔn gběhan nyanya lɛ́ɛ síin a?’ 
"“ ‘No,’ he answered, ‘because while you are pulling the weeds, you may root up the wheat with them. ","Gǎn yětɔn ka gbɛ́ nú yě bó ɖɔ: ‘Éeǒ! Mi táá wá yi xwe gběhan nyanya lɛ́ɛ hɔn gbé, bó ná hɔn jinukún ɖagbe lɛ́ɛ kpódó yě kpó ɖó kpɔ́. "
Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned,Fon
"He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. ","Jezu lɛ́ dó lǒ ɖěvo nú yě bó ɖɔ: “Axɔ́súɖuto sɛ́xwé tɔn cí atínkwín wínníwínní ɖé ɖɔhun, bɔ nya ɖé dó nyi gle tɔn mɛ. "
"Though it is the smallest of all your seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches.” ","Atínkwín énɛ́ ɔ́ wínní hú atínkwín ɖě lɛ́ɛ bǐ; lo ɔ́, hwenu e é wá wú ɔ́, atín tɔn yi jǐ hú atín ɖě lɛ́ɛ bǐ, káká bó húzú atín ɖaxó, bɔ xɛ lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ xo adɔ̌ nyi ala tɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ.” "
He told them still another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough.” ,"Jezu lɛ́ dó lǒ ɖěvo nú yě bó ɖɔ: “Axɔ́súɖuto sɛ́xwé tɔn cí tɔ́n ɖɔhun, bɔ nǎwe ɖé sɔ́ dó linfín nǎ yi gannú atɔn mɔ̌ mɛ, bónú linfín nyinya ɔ́ bǐ ná dó fɔ́n.” "
Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables,Fon
"So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: “I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.” ",bónú xó e gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn ko ɖɔ ɔ́ ná dó jɛ
"Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.” ","Jezu nyi togun ɔ́, bó yi xwé gbe, bɔ ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ sɛkpɔ́ ɛ, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Lǒ e a dǒ dó ɖɔ xó dó gběhan nyanya e ɖo gle mɛ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, tínmɛ nú mǐ.” "
"“The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field. ","“Axɔ́súɖuto sɛ́xwé tɔn cí dɔkun e è zě hwlá dó gle ɖé mɛ ɔ́ ɖɔhun. Nya ɖé wá yi tɔ́n dó dɔkun énɛ́ ɔ́ jí, bó lɛ́ zé hwlá.

"“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. ",“Axɔ́súɖuto sɛ́xwé tɔn lɛ́ cí ajɔ̌tɔ́ e ɖo jɛ̌ ɖagbe ɖagbe lɛ́ɛ ba wɛ ɔ́ ɖɔhun. 
"When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it. ","É wá yi mɔ jɛ̌ xɔ akwɛ́ ɖaxó énɛ́ ɖokpó ɖo mɛɖé sí, bó yi sa nǔ e ɖo así tɔn lɛ́ɛ bǐ, bó zé akwɛ́ ɔ́ dó wá xɔ ná.” "
"“Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish. ","“Axɔ́súɖuto sɛ́xwé tɔn lɛ́ cí ɖɔ e è nyi dó tɔ mɛ, bɔ é wlí hweví tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ é ɖɔhun. "
"When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away. ","Ée hweví gɔ́ ɖɔ ɔ́, ɖɔnyitɔ́ lɛ́ɛ dɔn wá agě jí; yě jínjɔ́n tɔ ɔ́ tó, bó ɖe ɖɛ hweví lɛ́ɛ; yě cyán ɖagbe lɛ́ɛ dó nǔ mɛ, bó bɛ́ ée má nyɔ́ ǎ lɛ́ɛ nyi gbě. "
This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous ,"Mɔ̌ wɛ é ná nyí gbɔn ɖo gbɛvivɔzán gbe. Wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ ná cyán mɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ sín mɛ ɖagbe lɛ́ɛ mɛ, "

"“Have you understood all these things?” Jesus asked. “Yes,” they replied. ","Ée Jezu ɖɔ xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ gúdo ɔ́, é wá kanbyɔ́ ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Mi mɔ nǔ jɛ xó e un ɖɔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ mɛ a?” Yě ká yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Ɛɛn, mǐ mɔ nǔ jɛ mɛ.” "
"He said to them, “Therefore every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.” ",Jezu ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ e wá húzú axɔ́súɖuto sɛ́xwé tɔn sín ahwanvú ɔ́ cí xwétɔ́ e cyán nǔ yɔ̌yɔ́ kpódó nǔ xóxó kpó sín dɔkun tɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɔ́ ɖɔhun.” 
"When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there. ","Ée Jezu dó lǒ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ fó ɔ́, é gosín fínɛ́, "
"Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. “Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?” they asked.

"“Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary, and aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas? ","Atínkpatɔ́ví ɔ́ nɛ́ ǎ cé? Mali wɛ nyí nɔ tɔn ǎ cé? Nɔví tɔn lɛ́ɛ wɛ nyí Jaki kpódó Jozɛ́fu kpó, Sinmɔ́ɔ kpó Judi kpán ǎ cé? "

"And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus, ","Jezu ka jlɛ́ nǔ gěgé ɖé ɖo fínɛ́ ǎ, ɖó nǔmaɖi yětɔn wú.Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, tokpɔngán Elódu se nǔwiwa Jezu tɔn lɛ́ɛ, "

"And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves.

"Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan!

"For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it. ","Ɖó mɛ e jló ná hwlɛ́n gbɛ éɖée tɔn gán ɔ́, gbɛ tɔn ná bú dó e; mɛ e ka ná hɛn gbɛ tɔn bú ɖó nyɛ wútu ɔ́, ná hwlɛ́n gbɛ tɔn gán. "

"For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what he has done. ","Ɖó nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ ná wá ɖo susu Mawu Tɔ́ ce tɔn mɛ, nyɛ kpódó wɛnsagun tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó, bó ná ná nǔ e mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó wa ɔ́ sín ajɔ ɛ. "
"I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. ","Ma ɖɔ nǔgbó nú mi: mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖo mi mɛ fí din, bó ná ko kú cóbó ná mɔ nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ wá ɖu axɔ́sú ɖo gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ nu ǎ.”Azǎn tɔn ayizɛ́n gúdo ɔ́, Jezu kplá Piyɛ́ɛ, bó kplá Jaki kpódó Jaki nɔví Jǎan kpó, bɔ yě yi xá só ɖaxó ɖé jí; mɛ ɖěbǔ sɛkpɔ́ yě ǎ.

"There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light. ","Jezu húzú agbaza ɖo nukɔn yětɔn, bɔ nukún tɔn mɛ nɔ́ kɔ́n ɖi hwesivɔ́ ɖɔhun; bɔ awu tɔn lɛ́ɛ wé pépé. "
"Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus. ",Ahwanvú tɔn atɔn lɛ́ɛ mɔ Mɔyízi kpó Elíi kpó ɖo xó ɖɔ xá ɛ wɛ. 
"Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here.

"While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.

"As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, “Don't tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.” ","Hwenu yě wá ɖo te jɛ sín só ɔ́ jí wɛ ɔ́, Jezu gbɛ́ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi ma ɖɔ nǔ e mi mɔ ɔ́ nú mɛɖé cóbónú Mawu ná fɔ́n nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ sín kú ó.” "
"The disciples asked him, “Why then do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?” ",Ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ka kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Nɛ̌ ka gbɔn bɔ sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ ɖɔ Elíi wɛ ná jɛ nukɔn wá hwɛ̌?”

"But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.” ","Lo ɔ́, nyɛ ɖo ɖiɖɔ nú mi wɛ ɖɔ: Elíi ɔ́ ko wá, bɔ yě mɔ ɛ, cóbó tunwun i ǎ, lobo wa nǔ e jló yě lɛ́ɛ bǐ xá ɛ.

"“Lord, have mercy on my son,” he said. “He has seizures and is suffering greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water. ","“Aklúnɔ! Kú nǔbláwǔ nú vǐ ce, ɖó adǐngbekútɔ́ wɛ, bɔ é ɖo wǔvɛ́ mɔ wɛ ɖésú; hwɛhwɛ wɛ é nɔ́ ɖo myɔ mɛ jɛ wɛ, bó nɔ́ lɛ́ ɖo sin mɛ jɛ wɛ. "
"I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.” ","Un kplá ɛ wá nú ahwanvú towe lɛ́ɛ, yě ká kpé azɔn ɔ́ wú, bó gbɔ n'i ǎ.” "
"“O unbelieving and perverse generation,” Jesus replied, “how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you?

"He replied, “Because you have so little faith. I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there’ and it will move.

"After Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma tax came to Peter and asked, “Doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax?” ","Ée Jezu kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó byɔ́ Kafaanawúmu ɔ́, mɛ e nɔ yí takwɛ́ sinsɛnxɔ mɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ sɛ yá Piyɛ́ɛ bó kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌si midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ tɔn ka nɔ́ ná takwɛ́ sinsɛnxɔ mɛ tɔn ɔ́ ɖě ǎ wɛ a?” Piyɛ́ɛ yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: "
"“Yes, he does,” he replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus was the first to speak. “What do you think, Simon?” he asked. “From whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes–from their own sons or from others?” ","“Ɛɛn,” bó ɖidó xwé gbe.

"“But so that we may not offend them, go to the lake and throw out your line. Take the first fish you catch; open its mouth and you will find a four-drachma coin. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours.”At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” ","Lo ɔ́, nú mǐ ma wá nyí afɔklɛ́nnú nú yě ó wútu ɔ́, yi xu jí, bó yi ɖó mlɛ; hweví e a nǎ wlí dó nukɔn ɔ́, kɛ nu tɔn, a ná mɔ akwɛ́ e ná kpé takwɛ́ nyɛ kpó hwɛ kpó tɔn ɔ́ ɖokpó ɖ'é mɛ; sɔ́, bó dó yi sú takwɛ́ nyɛ kpó hwɛ kpó tɔn ná.”Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, ahwanvú Jezu tɔn lɛ́ɛ sɛ yá ɛ, bó kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌ wɛ ná ɖu gǎn ɖo mǐ nu ɖo axɔ́súɖuto sɛ́xwé tɔn mɛ?” "
He called a little child and had him stand among them. ,"Jezu ka ylɔ́ yɔkpɔ́vú ɖokpó, bó sɔ́ ɛ ɖó te ɖo tɛ́ntin yětɔn, "

"“This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart.”When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan.

"So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, yě sɔ́ ɖo mɛ we nyí wɛ ǎ, lo ɔ́, yě húzú mɛ ɖokpó géé. Ényí mɔ̌ hǔn, gbɛtɔ́ ní bó ma klán nǔ e Mawu dɔn cá ɔ́ ó.” "

"I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery.” ","Amɔ̌, má ɖɔ nú mi: ‘Ényí nyɔ̌nu ɖé ma dó afɔ gbě ǎ, bónú asú tɔn nya ɛ, bó da nyɔ̌nu ɖěvo ɔ́, aga wɛ súnnu énɛ́ ɔ́ lɛ.’ ” "

For some are eunuchs because they were born that way, and others have renounced marriage because of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.” 
Then little children were brought to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked those who brought them. ,"Hwenu e Jezu ɖɔ xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ vɔ ɔ́, è kplá yɔkpɔ́vú lɛ́ɛ wá n'i, bónú é ná ɖó alɔ ta nú yě, bó ná xo ɖɛ nú yě.

And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life. ,"bɔ mɛ ɖěbǔ e ná jó xwé tɔn dó, bó ná jó nɔví tɔn súnnu lɛ́ɛ, abǐ nyɔ̌nu lɛ́ɛ dó, bó ná jó tɔ́ tɔn kpódó nɔ tɔn kpó dó, abǐ vǐ tɔn lɛ́ɛ dó, bó ná jó ayǐkúngban tɔn lɛ́ɛ dó, ɖó nyɛ wútu ɔ́, Mawu ná ná ɛ nǔ e hú mɔ̌ ɔ́ donu kanwe ko (100), bó ná lɛ́ ná ɛ gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ.

"But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.“For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard. ","Mɛ e ɖo nukɔn din lɛ́ɛ gěgé ná wá jɛ gǔdo, bɔ mɛ e ɖo gǔdo din lɛ́ɛ gěgé ná wá jɛ nukɔn.”“Axɔ́súɖuto sɛ́xwé tɔn ɔ́, nǔ e wú è hɛn ɔ́, è nǎ jlɛ́ dó ɔ́ ɖíe: glenɔ ɖé fɔ́n zǎn tɔ́n gbe ɖokpó, bó ná yi ba azɔ̌watɔ́ dó vǐwungle tɔn mɛ.

He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard. ,"Azɔ̌watɔ́ e é mɔ jɛ nukɔn, ɖo zǎnzǎn gan ayizɛ́n mɛ mɔ̌ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, gankwɛ́ ɖokpó, gbe ɖokpó jí wɛ yě ɖɔ gbo dó; bɔ é nyi yě sɛ́ dó gle ɔ́ mɛ. "
“About the third hour he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing. ,"Glenɔ ɔ́ lɛ́ tɔ́n ɖo zǎnzǎnhwe mɛ xwe gan tɛ́nnɛ mɛ mɔ̌, bó lɛ́ mɔ mɛ ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ, bɔ yě kplé ɖo tokplétɛn nǔɖé ma wa, "

So they went. “He went out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did the same thing. ,"bɔ yě yi jɛ azɔ̌ wa jí ɖo gle ɔ́ mɛ nǔgbó. Glenɔ ɔ́ ka lɛ́ tɔ́n gan wěwe mɛ mɔ̌, bó lɛ́ tɔ́n gan atɔn mɛ hwelɛ́kɔ mɔ̌, bó bló nǔ ɖokpó ɔ́. "
"About the eleventh hour he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, ‘Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?’ ","Ée é jɛ gan atɔ́ɔ́n mɛ mɔ̌ ɔ́, glenɔ ɔ́ lɛ́ tɔ́n, bó yi mɔ mɛ ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ ɖo tokplétɛn, bó kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: ‘Étɛ́wú wɛ mi ka cí fí sín zǎnzǎn ɖokpóó káká jɛ lěhwenu nǔɖé ma wa?’ "

"“When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.’ ","“Ée gbadanu wá su ɔ́, glenɔ ɔ́ ɖɔ nú nǔjíkpɔ́ntɔ́ tɔn ɖɔ: ‘Yi ylɔ́ azɔ̌watɔ́ lɛ́ɛ wá, bó sú gbeɖokpókwɛ́ mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó, bɛ́ sín mɛ e wá gbɔn gǔdo bǐ lɛ́ɛ jí káká yi jɛ mɛ e wá jɛ nukɔn lɛ́ɛ jí.’ "
“The workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius. ,"Yě mɛ e wá jɛ azɔ̌ wa jí ɖo gan atɔ́ɔ́n mɛ hwelɛ́kɔ lɛ́ɛ wá, bɔ é sú gankwɛ́ ɖokpó ɖokpó yě. "
"So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius. ","Yě mɛ e jɛ azɔ̌ wa jí jɛ nukɔn lɛ́ɛ wá, lobo vɛdó ɖɔ émí lɛ́ɛ ná yí akwɛ́ hú mɔ̌ wɛ sín; lo ɔ́, gankwɛ́ ɖokpó ɖokpó jɛ́n è sú yě lɔmɔ̌. "
"When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner. ","Hwenu e yě ɖo akwɛ́ ɔ́ yí wɛ ɔ́, yě jɛ nǔ hlún ɖɔ dó glenɔ ɔ́ wú jí, "
"‘These men who were hired last worked only one hour,’ they said, ‘and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.’ ","bó nɔ́ ɖɔ: ‘Yě mɛ e wá gbɔn gǔdo lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, gan xixo ɖokpó jɛ́n wɛ yě dó wa azɔ̌ ná.

"“But he answered one of them, ‘Friend, I am not being unfair to you. Didn't you agree to work for a denarius? ","Glenɔ ɔ́ ka yí gbe nú mɛ ɖokpó ɖo yě mɛ, bó ɖɔ: ‘Xɔ́ntɔn ce; un ma ka wa nǔɖé nyi do nú we nɛ́; é má nyí gankwɛ́ ɖokpó jí wɛ mǐ ɖɔ gbo dó, cóbɔ mi jɛ azɔ̌ wa jí ǎ cé? "
Take your pay and go. I want to give the man who was hired last the same as I gave you. ,"Yǐ akwɛ́ e nyí towe ɔ́, bó yi xwé; gankwɛ́ ɖokpó ɔ́ wɛ jló mì, bɔ un sú mɛ élɔ́ e wá gbɔn gǔdo ɔ́ kpódó hwi kpó. "
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?’ ,"Un sixú sɔ́ akwɛ́ ce dó wa nǔ e jló mì ɔ́ ná ǎ cé? Wǔhwan wɛ a ɖe a? Un sɔ́ akwɛ́ ce dó wa ɖagbe ná ɔ́, hwɛ wɛ nyí bɔ un hu a?’ ” "
"“So the last will be first, and the first will be last.” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, Jezu lɛ́ ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “È nǎ sɔ́ mɛ e ɖo gǔdo lɛ́ɛ wá nukɔn; bó ná sɔ́ mɛ e ɖo nukɔn lɛ́ɛ wá gǔdo.” "
"Now as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside and said to them, ","Hwenu e Jezu ɖo kpó fán wɛ xwe Jeluzalɛ́mu ɔ́, é ylɔ́ ahwanvú tɔn wěwe lɛ́ɛ ɖó vo, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: "
"“We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death ","“Mǐ ɖíe xwe Jeluzalɛ́mu e; è nǎ jó nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ nú vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpó, bɔ yě ná ɖó kúhwɛ nú mì, "
and will turn him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified.

"Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus with her sons and, kneeling down, asked a favor of him. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, Zebeɖée ví lɛ́ɛ sín nɔ sɛ yá Jezu é kpódó vǐ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó; é jɛ kpo ɖo Jezu nukɔn, bó ɖe kɔ́ n'i, bó jló ná byɔ́ nǔɖé e. "
"“What is it you want?” he asked.

"“You don't know what you are asking,” Jesus said to them. “Can you drink the cup I am going to drink?” “We can,” they answered. ","Jezu ka yí gbe nú vǐ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Mi tunwun nǔ e byɔ́ wɛ mi ɖe ɔ́ ǎ. Wǔvɛ́ kɔ́fu e nu gbé wɛ un ja ɔ́, mi sixú kpé wú bó nu a?” Yě ká yí gbe ɖɔ: “Ɛɛn mǐ ná kpé wú.” "
"Jesus said to them, “You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father.” ","Jezu ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi ná wá nu wǔvɛ́ kɔ́fu ce énɛ́ ɔ́ nǔgbó; amɔ̌, ɖisíxwé ce kpódó amyɔxwé ce kpó ná jínjɔ́n ɔ́, nyɛ wɛ ná ná ǎ; mɛ e Mawu ko bló tɛnmɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖ'ayǐ ná lɛ́ɛ tɔn wɛ.” "
"When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers. ","Ée Jezu sín ahwanvú wǒ ɖě lɛ́ɛ se xó énɛ́ ɔ́, yě sin xomɛ dó nɔví nɔví we énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ. "
"Jesus called them together and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.

"Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, ","Nǔ ka ɖó ná nyí mɔ̌ ɖo midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ tɛ́ntin ǎ; lo ɔ́, mɛ ɖěbǔ e jló ná nyí gǎn ɖo mi mɛ ɔ́, ní nyí mɛsɛntɔ́ mitɔn. "
and whoever wants to be first must be your slave– ,"Mɛ ɖěbǔ ka jló ná nyí nukɔntɔ́ ɖo mi mɛ ɔ́, ní nyí kannumɔ mitɔn. "
"just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” ","Mɔ̌ wɛ ɖe gbɔn nú nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́; è nǎ sɛn mì wú wɛ un wá ǎ; lo ɔ́, mɛ sɛn gbé wɛ un tɔ́n bó wá, bó ná sɔ́ gbɛ ce jó dó xɔ gbɛ nú mɛ gěgé.” "
"As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him. ","Hwenu e Jezu kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó tɔ́n sín Jeliko, bó ɖo yiyi wɛ ɔ́, ahwan wɔ̌buwɔ́bú ɖé xwedó e. "
"Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was going by, they shouted, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!” ","Nukúntíntɔ́nnɔ we ɖé lɛ́ɛ ka ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n ɖo ali ɔ́ kpá.

"The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all the louder, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!” ","Ahwan e xwedó Jezu lɛ́ɛ ka bɛ́ adǎn dó yě jí, bó ɖɔ yě ní xwɛ. Lo ɔ́, yě lɛ́ sú xó syɛ́nsyɛ́n, bó ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ! Davídi ví, kú nǔbláwǔ nú mǐ.” "

"“Lord,” they answered, “we want our sight.” ","Bɔ yě yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ, a ní hun nukún nú mǐ.” "
"Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him.As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, ","Bɔ Jezu kú nǔbláwǔ nú yě, bó ɖó alɔ nukún yětɔn lɛ́ɛ jí, bɔ yě mɛ we lɛ́ɛ bǐ sín nukún hun tlóló, bɔ yě jɛ nǔ mɔ jí, bó xwedó Jezu.Ée Jezu kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó sɛkpɔ́ Jeluzalɛ́mu, bó ko ɖo malín málín mɛ dó Bɛtifajée toxo ɔ́, ɖo olívutín só ɔ́ kɔn dɔ̌n ɔ́, Jezu sɛ́ ahwanvú tɔn we dó; "

This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet: ,"Nǔ cí mɔ̌, bónú xó e Mawu ko ɖɔ ɖ'ayǐ gbɔn gbeyíɖɔ tɔn jí ɔ́ ná dó jɛ; é wɛ nyí ɖɔ: "

The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them. ,"Ahwanvú tɔn we lɛ́ɛ ka yi toxo ɔ́ mɛ, bo bló lě e Jezu ɖɔ gbɔn nú yě é. "
"They brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them. ","Yě kplá tócí ɔ́ kpódó vǐ tɔn kpó wá, bó tɛ́ awu yětɔn nyi yě jǐ, bɔ Jezu jínjɔ́n jí. "
"A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. ","Mɛ gěgé tɛ́ avɔ yětɔn nyi ali ɔ́ jí, mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ ka yi fɛ́n atínla lɛ́ɛ, bó tɛ́ kɔn nyi ali ɔ́ jí. "
"The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!” “Hosanna in the highest!” ","Mɛ e ɖo nukɔn nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ kpódó mɛ e ɖo gǔdo n'i lɛ́ɛ kpán nɔ́ ɖo xó sú wɛ, bó nɔ́ ɖɔ: “Ozána nú Davídi ví!

"When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, “Who is this?” ","Ée Jezu byɔ́ Jeluzalɛ́mu ɔ́, to ɔ́ mɛ nu lɛ́ɛ bǐ xozǐn, bó nɔ́ ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌ wɛ ka nyí nya énɛ́ ɔ́?” "

Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. ,"Ée Jezu yi Jeluzalɛ́mu ɔ́, é byɔ́ sinsɛnxɔ mɛ, bó nya mɛ e ɖo nǔ sa wɛ ɖo xɔ ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ kpódó mɛ e ɖo nǔ xɔ wɛ lɛ́ɛ kpó bǐ tɔ́n; é flí akwɛ́ɖyɔ́tɔ́ e ɖo xɔ ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ sín távo xwe, bó flí ahwannɛ́satɔ́ lɛ́ɛ sín azinkpo nyi ayǐ.

"The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them. ","Nukúntíntɔ́nnɔ lɛ́ɛ kpódó mɛ e gblé wɔ̌n lɛ́ɛ kpó ka sɛ wá Jezu gɔ́n, ɖo sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́ mɛ, bɔ é gbɔ azɔn nú yě. "
"But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple area, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they were indignant.

"“Do you hear what these children are saying?” they asked him. “Yes,” replied Jesus, “have you never read, “ ‘From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise’?” ",bɔ yě ɖɔ nú Jezu ɖɔ: “A se nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ vǐ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖe ɔ́ ǎ cé?” Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Un se ganjí hǔn.

"And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night. ","Ée Jezu ɖɔ xó énɛ́ ɔ́ vɔ ɔ́, é jó yě dó nyi fínɛ́, bó tɔ́n sín toxo ɔ́ mɛ, bó yi dɔ́ gletoxo e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Betaníi é mɛ. "
"Early in the morning, as he was on his way back to the city, he was hungry. ","Ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn zǎnzǎn, hwenu e Jezu lɛ́ kɔ sín Betaníi, bó ja Jeluzalɛ́mu ɔ́, xovɛ́ sin i. "
"Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, “May you never bear fruit again!” Immediately the tree withered. ","É mɔ fígitín ɖokpó ɖo ali ɔ́ xo, bó yi sá, é ka mɔ nǔɖé ɖ'é jí zɛ ama tɔn lɛ́ɛ wú ǎ; é dó nu fígitín ɔ́, bó ɖɔ: “A sɔ́ ná sɛ́n ɖě gbeɖé ǎ,” bɔ atín ɔ́ mlú ɖa tlóló. "
"When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?” they asked. ","Ée ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ mɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, é kpácá yě tlala, bɔ yě kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Nɛ̌ atín ɔ́ ka mlú ɖa gbɔn tlóló nɛ́?” "
"Jesus replied, “I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it will be done. ","Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Má ɖɔ nǔgbó nú mi: ényí mi ɖó nǔɖiɖi, bó má nɔ́ xo nǔ kpɔ́n ǎ ɔ́, nǔ e un jlɛ́ dó atín énɛ́ wú din, bɔ mi mɔ ɔ́ kɛ́ɖɛ́ wɛ mi ná jlɛ́ ǎ; lo ɔ́, nú mi na bo ɖɔ nú só élɔ́ ɖɔ: ‘Hɔn hwiɖée sín fí, bó yi jɛ xu mɛ’ ɔ́, nǔ ná nyí mɔ̌.

"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.” ","Nǔ ɖěbǔ e mi na xo ɖɛ kpódó nǔɖiɖi kpó, bó byɔ́ Mawu ɔ́, é ná ná bǐ mi.” "
"Jesus entered the temple courts, and, while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. “By what authority are you doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave you this authority?” ","Hwenu e Jezu byɔ́ sinsɛnxɔ mɛ, bó ɖo nǔ kplɔ́n mɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ ɔ́, vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó tomɛxó lɛ́ɛ kpó sɛ yá ɛ, bó kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Acɛ tɛ́ a ka ɖó, bó nɔ́ ɖo nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ wa wɛ?

"Jesus replied, “I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. ","Jezu ka yí xó, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Nyɛ lɔ ná kan nǔ ɖokpó byɔ́ mi. Ényí mi ná sin tɔn mì ɔ́, nyɛ lɔ ná ɖɔ acɛ e un ɖó, bó nɔ́ wa nǔ gbɔn mɔ̌ ɔ́ nú mi. "
"John's baptism–where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?” They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn't you believe him?’ ","Jǎan Yɛhwesinlɛnúmɛtɔ́ ɔ́, mɛ̌ ka ná ɛ acɛ, bɔ é nɔ́ lɛ yɛhwesin nú mɛ?

"But if we say, ‘From men’–we are afraid of the people, for they all hold that John was a prophet.” ","Ényí mǐ ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ wɛ ɔ́, mǐ ɖó ná ɖi xɛsi nú togun ɔ́; ɖó yě bǐ wɛ sɔ́ Jǎan dó ɖó gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn ná.” "
"So they answered Jesus, “We don't know.” Then he said, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, yě gbɔ bó yí gbe nú Jezu ɖɔ: “Mǐ tunwun ǎ.” Bɔ Jezu ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Hǔn nyɛ lɔ ɖo mɛ e ná acɛ mì, bɔ un nɔ dó wa nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ná ɔ́ ná ɖɔ nú mi wɛ ǎ.” "
"“What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work today in the vineyard.’ ","“Mi ɖótó xó élɔ́, bó ɖɔ nǔ e mi lin d'é wú ɔ́ nú mì: nya ɖé ɖó vǐ súnnu we, bó ɖɔ nú mɛ nukɔntɔn ɔ́ gbe ɖokpó ɖɔ jí: ‘Vǐ ce, égbé ɔ́, a na yi wa azɔ̌ ɖo vǐwungle ce mɛ.’ "
"“ ‘I will not,’ he answered, but later he changed his mind and went. ","Vǐ ɔ́ ka gbɛ́; zaanɖé ɔ́, é húzú ayixa bó yi wa azɔ̌ ɖo gle ɔ́ mɛ. "
"“Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, ‘I will, sir,’ but he did not go. ","Tɔ́ yětɔn ka lɛ́ yi ɖɔ xó ɖokpó ɔ́ nú vǐ wegɔ́ ɔ́. Éyɛ́ yí gbe nú tɔ́ ɔ́ ɖɔ: ‘Daá, un ná yi;’ é ka yi ǎ. "
"“Which of the two did what his father wanted?” “The first,” they answered. Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. ","Ɖo vǐ we énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɔ́, mɛ̌ ka wa tɔ́ tɔn sín jlǒ?” Bɔ yě yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Vǐ nukɔntɔn ɔ́ wɛ.” Jezu ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Má ɖɔ nǔgbó nú mi: tokwɛ́yítɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpódó agalɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpó ná jɛ nukɔn nú mi ɖo axɔ́súɖuto Mawu tɔn mɛ.

"For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him. ","Ɖó Jǎan wá mi gɔ́n, bó kplɔ́n nǔ mi dó lě e mi ná wa nǔ jlɔ́jlɔ́ gbɔn ɔ́ wú, bɔ midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mi ka yí xó tɔn se ǎ.

"“Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey. ","“Mi bo lɛ́ ɖótó lǒ ɖěvo: Nya xwétɔ́ ɖé ɖó ayǐkúngban, bó dó vǐwun kɔn nyi jí, lobo dó kpá lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó bǐ; é lɛ́ kun vǐwunto ɖokpó dó vǐwungbo ɔ́ mɛ.

"When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit. ","Ée vǐwun gbigbɛ hwenu wá su ɔ́, nya ɔ́ sɛ́ mɛsɛntɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ dó vǐwunzɔ́watɔ́ lɛ́ɛ gɔ́n, bónú yě ná yí vǐwun e nyí étɔn ɔ́ wá n'i. "
"“The tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third. ","Hwenu e mɛsɛntɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ yi vǐwunzɔ́watɔ́ lɛ́ɛ gɔ́n ɔ́, vǐwunzɔ́watɔ́ lɛ́ɛ wlí yě, bó xo mɛ ɖokpó ɖo yě mɛ, bó hu mɛ wegɔ́ ɔ́, lobo ɖó awǐnnyaglo nú mɛ atɔngɔ́ ɔ́. "
"Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way. ","Nya ɔ́ lɛ́ sɛ́ mɛsɛntɔ́ ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ dó, bɔ yě sukpɔ́ hú mɛ nukɔntɔn lɛ́ɛ. Vǐwunzɔ́watɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ka lɛ́ wa nǔ yětɔn lě e yě wa mɛ nukɔntɔn lɛ́ɛ sín nǔ gbɔn é. "
"Last of all, he sent his son to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said. ","Gbɔn gǔdo bǐ ɔ́, nya ɔ́ wá sɛ́ vǐ é ɖésúnɔ tɔn dó yě, ɖó é ɖo ɖiɖɔ dó ayi mɛ wɛ ɖɔ: ‘Yě mɔ vǐ ce ɖésú ɔ́, yě ná sí i.’ "
"“But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, ‘This is the heir. Come, let's kill him and take his inheritance.’ ","Lo ɔ́, ɖěe vǐwunzɔ́watɔ́ lɛ́ɛ mɔ vǐ tɔn lě ɔ́, yě ɖɔ ɖo yěɖée tɛ́ntin ɖɔ: ‘Vǐ e ɖo xu ɔ́ ná ɖu wɛ é ɖíe; mi wá bónú mǐ ná hu i, bónú vǐwungbo ɔ́ ná húzú mǐtɔn.’ "
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, yě zɔn vǐ ɔ́ jí, bó dɔn ɛ yi vǐwungbo ɔ́ gúdo, bó hu i.” "
"“Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?” ","Jezu kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Ényí vǐwunglenɔ ɔ́ ka wá ɔ́, nɛ̌ wɛ é ka ná wa vǐwunzɔ́watɔ́ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ sín nǔ gbɔn?” "
"“He will bring those wretches to a wretched end,” they replied, “and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time.” ","Yě yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “É ná hu nya dídá énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ma kpɔ́n gǔdo, bó ná sɔ́ vǐwungbo ɔ́ dó alɔ mɛ nú vǐwunzɔ́watɔ́ ɖěvo e ná nɔ ná ɛ kanta tɔn dó hwetɔnnu lɛ́ɛ é.” "
"Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures: “ ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes’? ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, Jezu ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi mɔ xó élɔ́ xa ɖo Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ǎ cé?

“Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́ wútu wɛ un ɖo ɖiɖɔ nú mi wɛ ɖɔ: ‘Mawu ná ɖe mi sín axɔ́súɖuto tɔn mɛ, bó ná sɔ́ akɔta e nǔwiwa yětɔn lɛ́ɛ jɛ xá axɔ́súɖuto tɔn lɛ́ɛ d'é mɛ, [ "

"When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables, they knew he was talking about them. ","Ée vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ kpó se lǒ e Jezu dó nɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, yě mɔ nǔ jɛ wú ganjí ɖɔ émí xó ɖɔ wɛ é ɖe, "
"They looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet.Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: ","bɔ yě ɖo biba ná wlí i wɛ; lo ɔ́, yě ɖi xɛsi nú togun ɔ́, ɖó togun ɔ́ sɔ́ Jezu dó ɖó gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn ná.Jezu lɛ́ dó lǒ dó ɖɔ xó nú yě ɖɔ: "
“The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. ,"“Axɔ́súɖuto sɛ́xwé tɔn ɔ́, nǔ e wú è hɛn ɔ́, è nǎ jlɛ́ dó ɔ́ ɖíe: axɔ́sú ɖé ylɔ́ agɔ̌ gbe ɖokpó, ɖó vǐ tɔn ɖo asi ná kplá wɛ. "
"He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come. ","Axɔ́sú énɛ́ sɛ́ deví tɔn lɛ́ɛ dó, bónú yě yi ylɔ́ mɛ e é da, bɔ yě ná wá ɖu agɔ̌ xá ɛ lɛ́ɛ wá; lo ɔ́, mɛ lɛ́ɛ jló ná wá ǎ. "
"“Then he sent some more servants and said, ‘Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.’ ","É lɛ́ sɛ́ deví tɔn ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ dó, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: ‘Mi yi ɖɔ nú mɛ e un da lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ nǔɖuɖu lɛ́ɛ ko sɔgbe; un hu nyibú ce asú lɛ́ɛ, bó hu kanlin ce e dó jǒ lɛ́ɛ; nǔ bǐ ko sɔgbe; mi wá ɖu agɔ̌.’ "
"“But they paid no attention and went off–one to his field, another to his business. ","Lo ɔ́, mɛ e è da lɛ́ɛ dó vɛ̌ nú nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ, bó ɖidó nǔ yětɔn yětɔn wa gbé; mɛ ɖě ɖidó gleta, mɛ ɖě ɖidó ajɔ̌ tɔn wa gbé. "
"The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them. ","Mɛ ɖě ká zɔn mɛsɛntɔ́ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ jí, bó dó ya nú yě káká bó hu yě. "
The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. ,"Axɔ́sú ɔ́ sin xomɛ tlala, bó sɛ́ ahwan tɔn lɛ́ɛ dó, bɔ yě yi hu mɛhutɔ́ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ, bó dó toxo yětɔn zo. "

Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.’ ,"Mi gbɔ bó yi alikpléhɔ̌ntɛn lɛ́ɛ, bó ylɔ́ mɛ e mi ná mɔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ, bónú yě ní wá ɖu agɔ̌.’ "
"So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. ","Mɛsɛntɔ́ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ka yi gbɔn ali xo ali xo, bó kplá mɛ e yě mɔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ wá; mɛ ɖagbe kpódó mɛ nyanya kpó bǐ, bɔ gbɛtɔ́ gɔ́ agɔ̌ɖutɛn ɔ́. "

"“For many are invited, but few are chosen.” ","Bɔ Jezu wá sú ta nú xó ɔ́, bó ɖɔ: “Mɛ gěgé wɛ Mawu ylɔ́, mɛ kpɛɖé wɛ è ka cyán.” "
Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words. ,"Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ yi kpá dó Jezu wú, bó ɖe wě dó lě e yě ná sixú wa gbɔn, bó kan nǔ byɔ́ ɛ, dó ɖó mɔ n'i, bó ná dó wlí i ɖo xó ɖiɖɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɔ́ wú, "
"They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. “Teacher,” they said, “we know you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.

"That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. ","Gbe énɛ́ gbe ɖokpó ɔ́, sinsɛngbɛ́ e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Saduseɛn lɛ́ɛ wá Jezu gɔ́n. (Yě wɛ nɔ ɖɔ mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ kún ná fɔ́n ó.) Yě kanbyɔ́ Jezu ɖɔ: "

At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage,Fon
"But about the resurrection of the dead–have you not read what God said to you, ","Nǔ e ka kan fínfɔ́n sín kú mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ tɔn ɔ́, mi mɔ nǔ e Mawu ɖɔ d'é wú ɔ́ xa ǎ cé? É wɛ nyí ɖɔ: "
"‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.” ","‘Nyɛ wɛ nyí Mawu Ablaxámu tɔn, Mawu Izáki tɔn, Mawu Jakɔ́bu tɔn.’ Mawu nyí Mawu mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ tɔn ǎ; lo ɔ́, mɛ e ɖo gbɛ lɛ́ɛ sín Mawu wɛ é nyí.” "
"When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. ",Nǔ énɛ́ e Jezu kplɔ́n yě ɔ́ kpácá mɛ e se lɛ́ɛ bǐ. 
"Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together. ","Ée Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ se ɖɔ Jezu xwe Saduseɛn lɛ́ɛ sín nu dó xɔ ɔ́, yě sɛ́ ta kplé, "
"One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: ","bɔ sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ ɖokpó ɖo yě mɛ, bó jló ná ɖó mɔ nú Jezu, bó kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: "
"“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” ","“Mɛ̌si, sɛ́n tɛ́ wɛ ka ɖo tají ɖo sɛ́n lɛ́ɛ bǐ mɛ?” "
Jesus replied: “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ ,"Jezu yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “ ‘A nǎ yí wǎn nú Aklúnɔ Mawu towe kpódó ayi towe bǐ kpó, kpódó lǐndɔ̌n towe bǐ kpó, kpódó linlin towe bǐ kpó.’ "
This is the first and greatest commandment. ,Sɛ́n ɖaxó e jɛ nukɔn nú sɛ́n lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɔ́ nɛ́. 
And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ ,"Sɛ́n wegɔ́ ɔ́ e bɔ d'é wú, bó ɖi nukɔntɔn ɔ́ ɖíe: ‘A nǎ yí wǎn nú nɔzo towe hwi ɖésú ɖɔhun.’ "
All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.” ,"Sɛ́n we énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ jí wɛ Mɔyízisɛ́n lɛ́ɛ bǐ, kpódó nǔkplɔ́nmɛ gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ tɔn bǐ kpó jínjɔ́n.” "
"While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, ","Ée Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ kplé ɔ́, Jezu kan xó byɔ́ yě "
"“What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” “The son of David,” they replied. ",ɖɔ: “Ani mi ka lin dó Klísu ɔ́ wú? Mɛ̌ ví wɛ é nyí?” Yě yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Davídi ví wɛ é nyí.” 
"He said to them, “How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him ‘Lord’? For he says, ","Jezu ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Nú Davídi ví wɛ é nyí ɔ́, nɛ̌ ka gbɔn bɔ Yɛ ɔ́ sɔ́ xó élɔ́ dó ayi mɛ nú Davídi, bɔ é ylɔ́ Klísu ɔ́ ɖɔ: ‘Aklúnɔ,’ bó ɖɔ jí: "
“ ‘The Lord said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.” ’ ,"‘Aklúnɔ ɖɔ nú Aklúnɔ ce ɖɔ: Jínjɔ́n ɖisí ce xwé, káká nú má sɔ́ kɛntɔ́ towe lɛ́ɛ dó bló afɔɖótɛn towe.’ "
"If then David calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be his son?” ","“Hǔn ényí Davídi ɖésú ka ylɔ́ Klísu ɖɔ: ‘Aklúnɔ’ ɔ́, nɛ̌ wɛ é ka sixú lɛ́ nyí vǐ tɔn gbɔn?” "
"No one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions.Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: ","Mɛ ɖé ka sɔ́ kpé xósin ɖé wú bó ná ɛ ǎ; bɔ, sín gbe énɛ́ gbe ɔ́, mɛ ɖěbǔ sɔ́ nɔ́ glá kan nǔ byɔ́ Jezu ǎ.Jezu ɖɔ xó nú mɛ e xwedó e lɛ́ɛ kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó ɖɔ: "

"So you must obey them and do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. ","Hǔn, mi bo nɔ se tónú nú yě, bó nɔ́ bló nǔ e yě ɖɔ nú mi lɛ́ɛ bǐ; mi ma ka nɔ wa nǔ yě ɖɔhun ó; ɖó nǔ e kplɔ́n mi wɛ yě ɖe lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, yě ɖésú nɔ bló gbɔn jí ǎ. "

“Everything they do is done for men to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long,Fon

they love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have men call them ‘Rabbi.’ ,È nǐ dó gbe yě ɖo tokplétɛn lɛ́ɛ wɛ yě nɔ yí wǎn ná. Yě nɔ́ jló ɖɔ gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ní ylɔ́ émí ɖɔ: ‘Mɛ̌si.’

The greatest among you will be your servant. ,Mɛ e nyí gǎn mitɔn ɔ́ ɖó ná nyí mɛsɛntɔ́ mitɔn.

“This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor.” ,"È nǎ kó sa célu ɔ́ yí akwɛ́ gěgé, bó má nú wamamɔnɔ lɛ́ɛ.” "
"Aware of this, Jesus said to them, “Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me. ","Ée Jezu tunwun nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖe ɔ́, é ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Étɛ́ sín tagba dó nú nyɔ̌nu élɔ́ wɛ mi ka ɖe? Nǔ ɖagbe wɛ é wa nú mì hǔn. "
"The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me. ","Mi kpódó wamamɔnɔ lɛ́ɛ kpó ɖo kpɔ́ tɛgbɛ, bɔ mi hɛn ɔ́, mi ná wa ɖagbe nú yě hweɖěbǔnu. Lo ɔ́, nyɛ ɖe xá mi tɛgbɛ ǎ. "
"When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. ","Célu énɛ́ e é kɔn dó wǔtu ce ɔ́, agbaza ce blóɖó ɖó ayǐ wɛ é ɖe, nú gbe e gbe è nǎ ɖi mì é. "
"I tell you the truth, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.” ","Má ɖɔ nǔgbó nú mi: fí ɖěbǔ e è nǎ jlá Wɛn Ɖagbe élɔ́ gbɔn ɖo gbɛ ɔ́ bǐ mɛ ɔ́, è nǎ nɔ́ ɖɔ nǔ e nyɔ̌nu élɔ́ wa din ɔ́ sín xó, bó ná nɔ́ dó flín i ná.” "
Then one of the Twelve–the one called Judas Iscariot–went to the chief priests ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, mɛ e nyí Judási Isikaliɔ́ti ɖo ahwanvú Jezu tɔn wěwe lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɔ́ yi mɔ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ, "
"and asked, “What are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you?” So they counted out for him thirty silver coins. ","bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Étɛ́ mi ka ná ná mì, bónú má jó Jezu nú mi?” Bɔ yě sú i kpatágankwɛ́ gban (30). "
From then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over. ,"Sín gbe énɛ́ gbe ɔ́, Judási jɛ hwenu e ná nyɔ́ n'i, bɔ é ná jó Jezu nú yě ɔ́ ba jí. "
"On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?” ","Hwenu è nɔ ɖu wɔ̌xúxú e mɛ è ma dó tɔ́n ǎ ɔ́ sín xwezán nukɔntɔn ɔ́ gbe ɔ́, ahwanvú Jezu tɔn lɛ́ɛ sɛ yá ɛ, bó kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Fítɛ́ wɛ a jlǒ ɖɔ mǐ ní yi ɖa Dǐndínwáyixwe ɔ́ sín nǔɖuɖu nú we ɖe?” "
"He replied, “Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, ‘The Teacher says: My appointed time is near.

So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover. ,"Ahwanvú lɛ́ɛ ká yi bló nǔ e Jezu ɖɔ nú yě ɔ́, bó ɖa Dǐndínwáyixwe ɔ́ sín nǔɖuɖu ɖo fínɛ́. "
"When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve. ","Ée gbadanu wá su ɔ́, Jezu kpódó ahwanvú tɔn wěwe lɛ́ɛ kpó jínjɔ́n ayǐ, bó jɛ nǔ ɖu jí. "
"And while they were eating, he said, “I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me.” ","Hwenu e yě ɖo nǔ ɖu wɛ ɔ́, Jezu ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Má ɖɔ nǔgbó nú mi, mɛ ɖokpó ɖo mi mɛ, bo ná sa mì.” "
"They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, “Surely not I, Lord?” ","Ée ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ se mɔ̌ ɔ́, wǔ kú yě tlala. Bɔ yě ɖokpó ɖokpó jɛ nǔ kanbyɔ́ ɛ jí ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ nyɛ wɛ ǎ mɛ! Abǐ?” "
"Jesus replied, “The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. ",Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ jí: “Mɛ e kplé alɔ xá mì ɖo nǔsúnnúká mɛ ɔ́ wɛ. 
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.” ,"Nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ ɖó ná kú, lě e è ko wlán gbɔn ɖó wǔtu ce é; amɔ̌, heelú mɛ e ka ná sa mì é; mɛ énɛ́ gbɔ bó gɔn gbɛ wá ɔ́, é nyɔ́ n'i hú.” "
"Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, “Surely not I, Rabbi?” Jesus answered, “Yes, it is you.” ","Judási e ɖo na sá ɛ wɛ ɔ́ ka yí xó, bo ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌si! Nyɛ wɛ ǎ mɛ! Abǐ?” Jezu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Hwi wɛ ɖɔ.” "
"While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take and eat; this is my body.” ","Hwenu e yě ɖo nǔ ɖu wɛ ɔ́, Jezu zé wɔ̌xúxú bó dó kú nú Mawu, bó kán, lobo ná ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ bó ɖɔ: “Mi yí, bó ɖu, élɔ́ ɔ́, agbaza ce wɛ.” "
"Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you. ","É lɛ́ sɔ́ kɔ́fu ɖokpó bɔ vɛ̌ɛn ɖ'é mɛ, bɔ é dó kú nú Mawu, bó sɔ́ nú ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ, bo ɖɔ: “Mi yí, bónú mi bǐ ní nu. "
"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. ","Ɖó élɔ́ ɔ́, hun ce wɛ; hun e Mawu dó sɔ́ akɔjijɛ sín afɔ ɖó te ná ɔ́ wɛ. É wɛ kɔn nyi ayǐ, dó gbɛtɔ́ gěgé tamɛ, nú hwɛ sɔ́ kɛ mɛ. "
"I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father's kingdom.” ","Má ɖɔ nǔgbó nú mi: sín égbé ɔ́, un sɔ́ ɖo vɛ̌ɛn élɔ́ ɖě ná nu wɛ káká yi jɛ gbe e gbe nyɛ kpódó mi kpó ná lɛ́ wá nu yɔ̌yɔ́ ɔ́ ɖo axɔ́súɖuto Tɔ́ ce tɔn mɛ é ǎ.” "
"When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, yě ji xwe ɔ́ sín han lɛ́ɛ, bó ɖidó olívutín só ɔ́ jí. "
"Then Jesus told them, “This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: “ ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’ ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, Jezu ɖɔ nú ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Mi bǐ sésé wɛ ná hɔn jó mì dó ɖo zǎn élɔ́ mɛ.

"But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.” ","Lo ɔ́, hwenu e Mawu ná fɔ́n mì sín kú gúdo ɔ́, un ná jɛ nukɔn nú mi yi Galilée.” "
"Peter replied, “Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will.” ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka yí xó, bó ɖɔ nú Jezu ɖɔ: “Ényí mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ bǐ ná bó hɔn jó we dó ɔ́, nyɛ ná jó we dó gbeɖé ǎ.” "
"“I tell you the truth,” Jesus answered, “this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.” ","Jezu ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Má ɖɔ nǔgbó nú we; ɖo zǎn élɔ́ mɛ din ɔ́, cóbónú kokló ná kɔ́ así ɔ́, a nǎ kó gbɛ́ azɔn atɔn ɖɔ émí kún tunwun mì ó.” "
"But Peter declared, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.” And all the other disciples said the same. ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka lɛ́ yí xó, bó ɖɔ: “É ná bó byɔ́ ɖɔ ma yi kú xá we ɔ́, un ná gbɛ́ gbeɖé ɖɔ un kún tunwun we ó ǎ.” Bɔ ahwanvú ɖě lɛ́ɛ lɔ ɖɔ xó ɖokpó ɔ́. (Maki 14.32-42; Luki 22.39-46) "
"Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, Jezu kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó wá yi tɛn e mɛ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Jɛtisemaníi é, bɔ é ɖɔ nú ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Mi jínjɔ́n fí, bónú ma yi dɔ̌n bó yi xo ɖɛ bo wá.” "
"He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled. ","É ka kplá Piyɛ́ɛ kpódó Zebeɖée ví we lɛ́ɛ kpó, bɔ wǔ jɛ kúkú i jí, bɔ ado jɛ huhu i jí; "
"Then he said to them, “My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.” ","bɔ é ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ jí: “Aluwɛ e nɔ dɔn mɛ yi kú é mɛ wɛ un ɖe; mi nɔ fí, bó nɔ wunzɛn xá mì.” "
"Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.” ","Ée Jezu ɖɔ mɔ̌ nú yě ɔ́, é sɛ yi nukɔn kpɛɖé, bo xwe agbɔ̌nnusú do, bó jɛ ɖɛ xo jí ɖɔ: “Tɔ́ ce, ényí nǔ sixú nyí mɔ̌ hǔn, blǒ bónú ma gɔn wǔvɛ́ kɔ́fu élɔ́ nu.

Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. “Could you men not keep watch with me for one hour?” he asked Peter. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, Jezu lɛ́ kɔ wá ahwanvú tɔn atɔn lɛ́ɛ gɔ́n, bo mɔ yě ɖo amlɔ mɛ, bo ɖɔ nú Piyɛ́ɛ ɖɔ jí: “Mi sixú nɔ wunzɛn xá mì nú ganxixo ɖokpó vɔ́vɔ́ ǎ? "
"“Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.” ","Mi nɔ wunzɛn bó xo ɖɛ, bó ma wá jɛ tɛ́nkpɔ́n mɛ ó; ɖó gbɛtɔ́ ɖó jlǒ ɖagbe, agbaza tɔn ka ɖó gǎn ɖé ǎ.” "
"He went away a second time and prayed, “My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.” ","Jezu lɛ́ jó yě dó azɔn wegɔ́ ɔ́, bó yi xo ɖɛ ɖɔ: “Tɔ́ ce, wǔvɛ́ kɔ́fu élɔ́ ma sixú dín wǔtu ce, bónú un gɔn nunu ǎ jɛ́n wɛ hǔn, jlǒ towe ní bó nyí wiwa.” "
"When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, Jezu lɛ́ lɛ́ kɔ wá ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ gɔ́n, bó lɛ́ mɔ yě ɖo amlɔ mɛ, ɖó nukún yětɔn bǐ wɛ kpɛn. "
"So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing. ","Jezu ka jó yě dó, bó sɛ yi zɔ bó xo ɖɛ azɔn atɔngɔ́ ɔ́, bó lɛ́ vɔ́ nǔ ɖokpó lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ. "
"Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, é lɛ́ lɛ́ kɔ wá ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ gɔn, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi lɛ́ kpo ɖo amlɔ dɔ́ wɛ, bó ɖo gbigbɔ jɛ wɛ a?

"Rise, let us go! Here comes my betrayer!” ",Mi bo sí te nú mǐ ná yi. Mi kpɔ́n! Mɛ e ɖo sísɔ́ mì jó wɛ ɔ́ ɖíe kó sɛ yá e.” 
"While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people. ","Mɔ̌ ɖɔ wɛ Jezu ɖe kɛ́ɖɛ́ bɔ mɛ e nyí Judási ɖo ahwanvú tɔn wěwe lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɔ́ wá xwetɔ́n; mɛ gěgé ɖé lɛ́ɛ xwedó e, bó hɛn hwǐ kpódó kpo kpán.

Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The one I kiss is the man,Fon
"Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him. ","Ée yě wá ɔ́, Judási sɛ yá Jezu tlóló, bó ɖɔ: “Un dó gbe we Mɛ̌si!” Lobo kí si n'i. "
"Jesus replied, “Friend, do what you came for.” Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him. ","Jezu ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Xɔ́ntɔn, wa nǔ e gbé a tɔ́n ɔ́;” bɔ mɛ lɛ́ɛ ka zɔn Jezu jí, bó wlí i. "
"With that, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. ","Mɛ e ɖo kpɔ́ xá Jezu lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó ka ɖe alɔ, bó sún hwǐ, bó xú vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó ɔ́ sín mɛsɛntɔ́, bó kpa tó e. "
"“Put your sword back in its place,” Jesus said to him, “for all who draw the sword will die by the sword. ","Jezu ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ jí: “Sɔ́ hwǐ towe ɖó tɛn tɔn mɛ. Ɖó mɛ e nɔ sɔ́ hwǐ dó fun ahwan ná ɔ́, hwǐ kú wɛ é ná kú. "
"Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels? ","Hǔn, a ɖi ɖɔ un hɛn ɔ́, un ná ɖɔ nú Tɔ́ ce, bɔ é ná sɛ́ wɛnsagun sín ahwangbɛ́ wɔ̌buwɔ́bú donu wěwe jɛjí dó mì tlóló din ǎ cé? "
But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?” ,"Ényí mɔ̌ wɛ un ka ko bló gbɔn ɔ́, nɛ̌ wɛ xó e è ka ko ɖɔ, bó wlán dó Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ɖ'ayǐ ɔ́ ná jɛ gbɔn?” "
"At that time Jesus said to the crowd, “Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, Jezu ɖɔ nú ahwan ɔ́ ɖɔ jí: “Ajotɔ́ axánsúnxó wɛ un ka nyí, bɔ mi hɛn hwǐ kpódó kpo kpó, bó wá ja wlǐwlí mì gbé a?

But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples deserted him and fled. ,"Lo ɔ́, nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ jɛ, bónú xó e Mawu ko ɖɔ gbɔn gbeyíɖɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ jí, bɔ è wlǎn dó Mawuxówéma mɛ ɔ́ ná dó jɛ.” Ahwanvú Jezu tɔn lɛ́ɛ bǐ ka jó e dó, bó hɔn. "
"Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled. ","Mɛ e wlí Jezu lɛ́ɛ kplá ɛ hɛn yi vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó Kayífu xwé, ɖo fí e sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpódó tomɛxó lɛ́ɛ kpó ko kplé ɖe é. "
"But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome. ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka jɛ Jezu gúdo, é ka lɔn bó sɛkpɔ́ ɛ ǎ; é nɔ zɔ n'i káká yi vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó ɔ́ sín xwé gbe, bó yi jínjɔ́n mɛsɛntɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpá, bó ná dó mɔ do nú lě e nǔ lɛ́ɛ ná jɛ gbɔn é. "
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death. ,"Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó yě mɛ e ko ɖo toxóɖɔgbɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpán ka ɖo mɛ e ná ɖe kúnnu agɔ nú Jezu, bɔ yě ná mɔ tɛn bó ɖó kúhwɛ n'i ɔ́ ba wɛ. "
"But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally two came forward ","Mɛ gěgé wá ɖe kúnnu agɔ n'i; lo ɔ́, xó e yě ɖɔ lɛ́ɛ kpé, bónú è nǎ sixú ɖó kúhwɛ n'i ǎ. Gbɔn gǔdo bǐ ɔ́, mɛ we ɖé lɛ́ɛ wá xwetɔ́n, "

"Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?” ","Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó ɔ́ ka sí te, bó kanbyɔ́ Jezu ɖɔ: “Nǔ e kúnnuɖetɔ́ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ dó wǔ towe ɔ́ nɛ́, a ɖǒ nu ɖé ná kɛ d'é wú a?” "
"But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, “I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.” ","Jezu ka tin d'é mɛ n'i.

"“Yes, it is as you say,” Jesus replied. “But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.” ","Jezu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Hwi wɛ ɖɔ, lo ɔ́, un lɛ́ ɖo ɖiɖɔ nú mi wɛ ɖɔ: bɛ́ sín din ɔ́, mi ná mɔ nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n, ɖo Mawu Nǔbǐwúkpétɔ́ ɔ́ sín ɖisíxwé; mi ná lɛ́ mɔ mì, bɔ un ná gosín jǐxwé jǎwe, ɖo akpɔ́kpɔ́ jí.” "
"Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.

"What do you think?” “He is worthy of death,” they answered. ",Ani wɛ mi lin d'é wú?” Bɔ yě yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Nǔ wɛ é wa nyi do bɔ è ɖǒ ná hu i!” 
Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him ,"Ée yě ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě jɛ atán tún dó nukún mɛ n'i jí, bó jɛ nǔ dó e jí. Mɛ ɖě nɔ xo tomɛ n'i, "
"and said, “Prophesy to us, Christ. Who hit you?” ","bó nɔ ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Klísu, bo ɖɔ mɛ e xo we din ɔ́ nú mǐ nǎ kpɔ́n.” "
"Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. “You also were with Jesus of Galilee,” she said. ","Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, Piyɛ́ɛ ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n ɖo kɔ́xota, ɖo xwé ɔ́ gbe.

"Then he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them, “I don't know the man!” Immediately a rooster crowed. ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka jɛ nu dó éɖée jí, bo jɛ nǔ bǐ xwlé jí, bo ɖɔ: “Un tunwun nya énɛ́ ǎ.” Tlóló ɔ́, kokló kɔ así, "
"Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: “Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the decision to put Jesus to death.

"They bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor. ","Yě blá Jezu, bó kplá ɛ yi jó nú tokpɔngán Pilátu. "
"When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders. ","Ée Judási e jó Jezu ɔ́ mɔ ɖɔ è ɖǒ kúhwɛ n'i ɔ́, nǔ e é wa ɔ́ vɛ́ n'i, bɔ é sɔ́ gankwɛ́ gban (30) ɔ́ yi jó nú vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó tomɛxó lɛ́ɛ kpó, "

So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself. ,"Judási ka bɛ́ gankwɛ́ gban (30) lɛ́ɛ nyi dó sinsɛnxɔ mɛ, bó ɖidó. Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, é yi dó kan kɔ bo kú. "

So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners. ,"Ée yě gbéjé kpɔ́n káká ɔ́, yě wá ɖó gbe kpɔ́, bó sɔ́ akwɛ́ ɔ́ dó yi xɔ zɛ̌nmɛtɔ́ ɖé sín gle ná, bó dó ɖó kúxwé nú mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ. "
That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. ,Nǔ e wú è nɔ ylɔ́ ayǐkúngban énɛ́ ɔ́ ɖɔ kanjɔgle káká jɛ égbé ɔ́ nɛ́. 
"Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: “They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel, ","Nǔ nyí mɔ̌, bónú xó e Mawu kó ɖɔ ɖ'ayǐ gbɔn gbeyíɖɔ tɔn Jelemíi jí ɔ́ ná dó jɛ; é wɛ nyí ɖɔ: “Yě bɛ́ kpatágankwɛ́ gban (30) lɛ́ɛ; akwɛ́ énɛ́ jí wɛ Izlayɛ́li ví ɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ gbo dó, bó dó xɔ Jezu ná. "
"and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me.” ","Yě sɔ́ akwɛ́ ɔ́ dó xɔ zɛ̌nmɛtɔ́ ɖé sín gle ná, lě e Aklúnɔ ko ɖɔ gbɔn nú mì ɖ'ayǐ é.” "
"Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” “Yes, it is as you say,” Jesus replied. ","Ée Jezu wá tokpɔngán Pilátu nukɔn ɔ́, tokpɔngán ɔ́ kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Hwi wɛ nyí Jwifu lɛ́ɛ sín axɔ́sú ɔ́ a?” Jezu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Hwi wɛ ɖɔ.” "
"When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer. ","Lo ɔ́, hwenu e vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó tomɛxó lɛ́ɛ kpó ɖo hwɛ dó Jezu wɛ ɖo Pilátu nukɔn ɔ́, Jezu kɛ nu ǎ, "
"Then Pilate asked him, “Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?” ",bɔ Pilátu ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “A se hwɛ tobutóbú e dó we wɛ yě ɖe ɔ́ ǎ cé? Étɛ́ a mɔ d'é wú?” 
"But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge–to the great amazement of the governor. ","Jezu ka kɛ nu dó xó e yě ɖɔ dó wǔtu tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖěbǔ wú ǎ, bɔ é kpácá tokpɔngán ɔ́ tlala. "
Now it was the governor's custom at the Feast to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. ,"Dǐndínwáyi sín xwe hwenu tɛgbɛ ɔ́, tokpɔngán Hlɔ̌ma tɔn ɔ́ nɔ́ ɖe gantɔ́ e ahwan ɔ́ ko sixú byɔ́ ɛ ɔ́ ɖokpó nyi te. "
"At that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas. ","Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, gantɔ́ ɖokpó ka ɖo gankpá ɔ́ mɛ, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Jezu Balabási. Gantɔ́ énɛ́ ɔ́, to ɔ́ bǐ wɛ tunwun i. "
"So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, “Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?” ","Ée togun ɔ́ wá kplé ɔ́, Pilátu kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌ wɛ mi jló nú ma ɖe nyi te nú mi ɖo gantɔ́ lɛ́ɛ mɛ?

For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him. ,Ɖó é tunwun ganjí ɖɔ mɛnúvɛ́mɛwú wɛ zɔ́n bɔ yě wlí Jezu Klísu ɔ́ wá nú émí. 
"While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: “Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.” ","Hwɛ ɔ́ ɖɔ wɛ Pilátu ɖe, bɔ asi tɔn sɛ́ wɛn dó e ɖɔ jí: “Nǔɖé ní má kan we ɖo nya énɛ́ ɔ́ sín xó mɛ ó, xomɛvɔ́nɔ wɛ.

But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed. ,"Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó tomɛxó lɛ́ɛ kpó ka bló káká bɔ ahwan ɔ́ yí dó xó yětɔn jí, bó byɔ́ ɖɔ è jǒ Balabási, bó hu Jezu. "
"“Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” asked the governor. “Barabbas,” they answered. ","Tokpɔngán ɔ́ lɛ́ wá yí xó, bó kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Ɖo mɛ we élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɔ́, mɛ̌ wɛ mi jló bónú má ɖe nyi te nú mi?” Yě ká yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Balabási.” "
"“What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?” Pilate asked. They all answered, “Crucify him!” ","Pilátu ka kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Jezu e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Klísu ɔ́, nɛ̌ wɛ un ka ná wa éyɛ́ sín nǔ gbɔn?” Bɔ yě bǐ yí gbe bó ɖɔ: “Ká ɛ nyi aklúzu jí.” "
"“Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!” ",Pilátu ka lɛ́ kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Nǔ nyanya tɛ́ wɛ é ká wa?” Yě ká sú xó syɛ́nsyɛ́n bó ɖɔ: “Ká ɛ nyi aklúzu jí.” 
"When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. “I am innocent of this man's blood,” he said. “It is your responsibility!” ","Ée Pilátu mɔ ɖɔ xó ɔ́ kún ɖo émí kpa wɛ ó, bɔ zǐngídi ahwan ɔ́ tɔn ká ɖo jijɛ jí wɛ jɛ́n wɛ ɔ́, é sɔ́ sin, bó klɔ́ alɔ ɖo yě bǐ nukún mɛ, bó ɖɔ: “Un nyɔ́ nǔɖé do ɖo nya élɔ́ sín kú mɛ ǎ; mi wɛ é kan.” "
"All the people answered, “Let his blood be on us and on our children!” ",Bɔ ahwan ɔ́ bǐ yí gbe ɖɔ jí: “Nya élɔ́ sín kú ní nɔ kɔ nú mǐ kpódó vǐ mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó.” 
"Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified. ","Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, Pilátu ɖe Balabási nyi te nú yě, bo ka zɔ́n bɔ è xo Jezu ɖó bǎ wu. Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, é jó e nú sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ è ní yi ká ɛ nyi aklúzu jí. "
Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him. ,"Tokpɔngán ɔ́ sín sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ ka kplá Jezu yi hɔnmɛ, bo kplé ahwankpá ɔ́ bǐ dó wǔ tɔn. "
"They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, ","Yě ɖe awu e é dó lɛ́ɛ bǐ sín kɔ n'i, bó ka sɔ́ awu vɔvɔ ɖaxó ɖé dó n'i. "
"and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand and knelt in front of him and mocked him. “Hail, king of the Jews!” they said. ","Yě sɔ́ wun dó lɔn axɔ́súgbákún ɖokpó ná, bó sɔ́ xwe n'i, bó ba fántín ɖokpó dó alɔ tɔn ɖisí ɔ́ mɛ, bó nɔ́ jɛ kpo ɖo nukɔn tɔn, bó nɔ́ ɖo cícá ɛ ko wɛ ɖɔ: “Mǐ kan xwé byɔ́, Jwifu lɛ́ɛ xɔ́sú!” "
"They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again. ","Yě nɔ tún atán kɔn nyi wǔtu tɔn, lobo nɔ yí fántín ɔ́ sín así tɔn, bo nɔ dó ta n'i. "
"After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him. ","Ée yě cá ɛ ko mɔ̌ fó ɔ́, yě wá ɖe awu vɔvɔ ɖaxó ɔ́ sín kɔ n'i, bó lɛ́ sɔ́ awu é ɖésúnɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ dó n'i. Yě kplá ɛ, bó ná yi ká ɛ nyi aklúzu jí. "
"As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross. ","Ée yě tɔ́n sín toxo ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, yě kpé Silenɛ́ɛnu ɖokpó, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Sinmɔ́ɔ. Sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ hú gǎn ɛ, bó ɖíɖá ɛ aklúzu Jezu tɔn. "
They came to a place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull). ,"Ée yě jɛ tɛn e mɛ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Gɔlugɔta dó Ebléegbe mɛ ɔ́, Gɔlugɔta ɔ́ sín tínmɛ wɛ nyí “takágo tɛnmɛ”. "
"There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it. ","Yě wún vɛ̌ɛn bó kɔn nǔvívɛ́ ɖé d'é mɛ, bó ná Jezu ɖɔ ní nu. Ée é dó nu ɔ́, é gbɛ́ nunu. "
"When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. ","Sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ ká Jezu nyi aklúzu jí; yě nyi akɔ dó awu tɔn lɛ́ɛ, bó má. "
"And sitting down, they kept watch over him there. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ jínjɔ́n ayǐ, bó jɛ cícɔ́ ɛ jí. "
"Above his head they placed the written charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS. ","Bó ná dó ɖe nǔ e sín kúhwɛ è ɖǒ n'i ɔ́ xlɛ́ ɔ́, è wlǎn nǔ élɔ́, bó ká dó aklúzu ɔ́ wú ɖo ta tɔn nu ɖɔ: “Jezu, Jwifu lɛ́ɛ xɔ́sú ɔ́ ɖíe.” "
"Two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. ","Yě ká ajotɔ́ axánsúnxó we nyi aklúzu jí gɔ́ n'i: mɛ ɖokpó ɖo ɖisí tɔn xwé, bɔ mɛ ɖokpó ɖo amyɔ tɔn xwé. "
"Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads ","Mɛ e ɖo dǐndín wɛ lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ húnhún ta, bó nɔ ɖo zunzun i wɛ, "
"and saying, “You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself!

"In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him. ","Mɔ̌ jɛ́n wɛ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ, kpódó sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpó, kpódó tomɛxó lɛ́ɛ kpó lɔ ɖo slǎmɛ ɖɔ wǔ tɔn wɛ, bó nɔ́ ɖɔ: "
"“He saved others,” they said, “but he can't save himself! He's the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.

"He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’ ” ","É ɖeji dó Mawu wú; nú Mawu ɔ́ yí wǎn n'i nǔgbó hǔn, ní bó hwlɛ́n ɛ gán nú mǐ ná kpɔ́n; ɖó é ɖɔ: ‘Un nyí Mawu ví.’ ” "
In the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him. ,Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́ wɛ ajotɔ́ e è ká ɖó akpá tɔn lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌ ɖo zunzun i gbɔn wɛ. 
From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land. ,"Sín gan wěwe mɛ káká yi jɛ gan atɔn mɛ ɔ́, ablu cyɔ́n to ɔ́ bǐ. "
"About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” –which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” ","Ée é wá su hwelɛ́kɔ ɔ́, Jezu sú xó gǎngán ɖé, bó ɖɔ: “Eli, Eli, lama sabakitani.” (Tínmɛ tɔn wɛ nyí: “Mawu ce, Mawu ce, nɛ̌ ka gbɔn bɔ a jǒ mì dó.”) "
"When some of those standing there heard this, they said, “He's calling Elijah.” ","Mɛ e ɖo fínɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖě se xó e Jezu ɖɔ nɛ́ ɔ́, bó ɖɔ: “É ɖo Elíi ylɔ́ wɛ.” "
"Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. ","Tlóló ɔ́, mɛ ɖokpó kán wezun, bó sɔ́ xumɛtekan nylɔ́ dó vɛ̌ɛn sinvɛ́sinvɛ́ mɛ, bó zé slɔ́ fántín gaga ɖé nu, bó dlɛ́n dó Jezu ɖɔ ní nu. "
"The rest said, “Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him.” ",Mɛ ɖé lɛ́ɛ ka ɖɔ nú mɛ e ɖo vɛ̌ɛn ná ɛ wɛ ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Gbɔ nú mǐ ná kpɔ́n ɖɔ Elíi ná wá hwlɛ́n ɛ gán a jí.” 
"And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit. ","Jezu lɛ́ sú xó ɖaxó ɖé, bó bɔnu. "
At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split. ,"Azɔn ɖokpó ɔ́, avɔ ɖaxó e ɖo sinsɛnxɔ mɛ ɔ́ dá ɖó we, sín jǐ wá do; ayǐkúngban dán wǔ, bɔ awǐnnya lɛ́ɛ zɛ. "
The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. ,"Yɔdo lɛ́ɛ hun, bɔ mɛɖeɖóvo Mawu tɔn e kó kú lɛ́ɛ gěgé fɔ́n. "
"They came out of the tombs, and after Jesus' resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people. ","Yě tɔ́n sín yɔdo lɛ́ɛ mɛ, bɔ ée Jezu fɔ́n gúdo ɔ́, yě byɔ́ Jeluzalɛ́mu to mímɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ, bɔ mɛ gěgé mɔ yě. "
"When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, “Surely he was the Son of God!” ","Ée sɔ́ja kanwekogán ɔ́ kpódó sɔ́ja e ɖo Jezu cɔ́ xá ɛ wɛ lɛ́ɛ kpó mɔ lě e ayǐkúngban dán wǔ gbɔn, bó mɔ lě e nǔ lɛ́ɛ jɛ gbɔn ɔ́, xɛsi ɖaxó ɖé jɛ yě jí, bɔ yě ɖɔ jí: “Nya élɔ́ ɔ́, Mawu ví wɛ é nyí nǔgbó.” "
"Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs. ","Nyɔ̌nu e nɔ xwedó Jezu bó nɔ dó alɔ ɛ lɛ́ɛ gěgé xwedó e sín Galilée wá fínɛ́. Yě ɖo te, bó ɖo nǔ e ɖo jijɛ wɛ lɛ́ɛ kpɔ́n sɛ́ dó wɛ. "
"Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons. ","Mali Magidalanu ɔ́, Mali e nyí Jaki kpódó Jozɛ́fu kpó sín nɔ ɔ́, kpódó Zebeɖée ví lɛ́ɛ sín nɔ kpó ɖo yě mɛ. "
"As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. ","Cóbónú hwe ná yi xɔ ɔ́, nya akwɛ́nɔ ɖé wá; nya énɛ́ ɔ́, Alimatéenu wɛ, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Jozɛ́fu; ahwanvú Jezu tɔn wɛ nú é lɔmɔ̌. "
"Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. ","É wá yi mɔ tokpɔngán Pilátu, bó byɔ́ ɛ Jezu sín cyɔ. Pilátu ka ɖe gbe nú sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ, nú è ní jó cyɔ ɔ́ n'i. "
"Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, ","Jozɛ́fu ka ɖe cyɔ ɔ́ sín aklúzu jí, bó lɛ́ akwɛ́núvɔ yɔ̌yɔ́ ɖé dó, "
and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away. ,"bó sɔ́ yi ɖi dó yɔdo yɔ̌yɔ́ e é kún dó sóxo mɛ ɖ'ayǐ nú é ɖésúnɔ ɔ́ mɛ, bó blí awǐnnya ɖaxó ɖé dó yɔdo ɔ́ nu, bó yi. "
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. ,"Mali Magidalanu ɔ́ kpódó Mali ɖě ɔ́ kpó jínjɔ́n ayǐ ɖo fínɛ́, bó kpan nukɔn yɔdo ɔ́. "
"The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. ","Ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn e jɛ dó gbɔjɛzán gbe Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn gúdo ɔ́, vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ kpó zɔn kpɔ́ bo yi tokpɔngán Pilátu gɔ́n. "
"“Sir,” they said, “we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’ ","Bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ, mǐ flín ɖɔ hwenu e nya mɛblɛ́ɖutɔ́ énɛ́ kpo ɖo gbɛ ɔ́, é ɖɔ azǎn atɔngɔ́ ɔ́ gbe ɔ́, émí ná fɔ́n sín kú wá gbɛ. "
"So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.” ","Énɛ́ wútu ɔ́, nǎ gbe, bónú sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ ná yi cɔ́ yɔdo ɔ́ ganjí káká jɛ azǎn atɔngɔ́ ɔ́ gbe.

"“Take a guard,” Pilate answered. “Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.” ","Pilátu ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ ɖíe, mi bo kplá yě bónú yě ní yi cɔ́ yɔdo ɔ́ lě e mi jló gbɔn é.” "
"So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. ","Yě ká sú yɔdo ɔ́ ganjí, bó ɖó wuntun, lobo ɖó sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ fínɛ́.Aklúnɔzán gbe ayǐtéhɔ̌nnu ɖo gbɔjɛzán Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn gúdo ɔ́, Mali Magidalanu ɔ́ kpódó Mali ɖě ɔ́ kpán yi Jezu sín yɔdo kpɔ́n gbé. "
"There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. ","Tlóló ɔ́, ayǐkúngban dán wǔ kpódó hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n kpó; bɔ wɛnsagun Aklúnɔ tɔn ɖokpó jɛ te sín jǐxwé, bó wá blí awǐnnya e è dǒ sú yɔdo ɔ́ ná ɔ́ síin, bó jínjɔ́n jí. "
"His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. ",Wɛnsagun ɔ́ nɔ́ kɔ́n jǐkɛwun ɖɔhun
The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men. ,"Xɛsi jɛ sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ jí, bɔ yě jɛ sísɔ́sísɔ́ jí, bó jɛ ayǐ, lobo cí mɛ e kú é ɖɔhun. "
"The angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. ","Wɛnsagun ɔ́ ká ɖɔ nú nyɔ̌nu lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mi ma ɖi xɛsi ó, ɖó un tunwun ɖɔ Jezu e è ká nyi aklúzu jí ɔ́ ba wɛ mi ɖe. "
"He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. ","É ɖo fí ǎ. É ko fɔ́n sín kú wá gbɛ, lě e é ko ɖɔ gbɔn ɖ'ayǐ é. Mi wá kpɔ́n; fí e è sɔ́ ɛ ɖó ɖ'ayǐ ɔ́ ɖíe. "
Then go quickly and tell his disciples: ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.’ Now I have told you.” ,"‘Mi yá wǔ yi ɖɔ nú ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ é kó fɔ́n sín kú, bó jɛ nukɔn nú mi xwe Galilée; fínɛ́ wɛ mi ná mɔ ɛ ɖe.’ É jɛ́n nɛ́ un kó ɖɔ nú mi nɛ́.” "
"So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. ",Nyɔ̌nu lɛ́ɛ yá wǔ gosín yɔdo ɔ́ kɔn
"Suddenly Jesus met them. “Greetings,” he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. ","Yě ná mɔ nǔɖé ɔ́, Jezu jɛ́n wɛ wá kpé yě ɖo alixo, bó ɖɔ: “Un dó gbe mi;” bɔ yě jɛ kpo, bó ɖó alɔ afɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ wú bó ɖe kɔ́ n'i. "
"Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.” ","Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, Jezu ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi ma ɖi xɛsi ó. Mi yi, bó ɖɔ nú nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ yě ní yi Galilée; fínɛ́ wɛ yě ná mɔ mì ɖe.” "
"While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.

"When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money, ","Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó tomɛxó lɛ́ɛ kpó ka wá kpléta bó ɖe wě dó xó e sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ wá ɖɔ nú yě ɔ́ wú; yě ná akwɛ́ gěgé sɔ́ja énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ, "

"If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.” ","Ényí tokpɔngán ɔ́ na bo se ɔ́, mǐ ná cikpɛ n'i bó ná hwlɛ́n mi gán sín tagba mɛ.” "
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day. ,"Sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ yí akwɛ́ ɔ́, bó bló lě e è zɔ̌n yě gbɔn é, bɔ xó énɛ́ gba kpé Jwifu lɛ́ɛ mɛ káká jɛ égbé. "
"Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. ","Ahwanvú Jezu tɔn wǒ-ɖokpó lɛ́ɛ yi Galilée, ɖo só e Jezu kó jlɛ́ nú yě ɖ'ayǐ ɔ́ jí. "
"When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. ","Ée yě mɔ Jezu ɖo fínɛ́ ɔ́, yě ɖe kɔ́ n'i; lo ɔ́, mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖo yě mɛ, bó ɖo xixo kpɔ́n wɛ. "

"It is written in Isaiah the prophet: “I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way”– ","Gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn Ezayíi ko wlán ɖ'ayǐ ɖɔ: “Mawu ɖɔ: ‘Wɛnsagun ce ɖíe un sɛ́ dó e, bɔ é ná jɛ nukɔn nú we, bó ná bló ali ɖó nú we.’ "
"“a voice of one calling in the desert, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.’ ” ","É ná nɔ́ ɖo xó sú wɛ ɖo gbětótló mɛ, bó ná nɔ́ ɖɔ: ‘Mi bló ali ɖó nú Aklúnɔ, mi jlɔ́ ali tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖó.’ ” "
"And so John came, baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. ","Jǎan Yɛhwesinlɛnúmɛtɔ́ wá, bó nɔ́ ɖo xó sú wɛ ɖo gbětótló mɛ ɖɔ: “Mi lɛ́ kɔ sín hwɛ mitɔn lɛ́ɛ gúdo, bó wá lɛ yɛhwesin, bónú Mawu ná sɔ́ hwɛ mitɔn lɛ́ɛ kɛ mi.” "
"The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. ","Mɛ e ɖo Judée gbé jí lɛ́ɛ bǐ, kpódó mɛ e ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu lɛ́ɛ kpán nɔ́ wá gɔ̌n tɔn, bó nɔ́ ɖɔ hwɛ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ bǐ, bɔ Jǎan nɔ lɛ yɛhwesin nú yě ɖo Judɛ́ɛn tɔ ɔ́ mɛ. "
"John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. ","Awu kacakaca ɖé wɛ Jǎan nɔ dó, bɔ è sɔ́ lǎkúnmí sín fún dó lɔn ná, bɔ é nɔ́ sin anyǔgójíblánú. É nɔ́ ɖu wɛn kpódó wǐin akú kpó. "
"And this was his message: “After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. ","É nɔ́ ɖo Mawuxó ɔ́ jlá togun lɛ́ɛ wɛ ɖɔ: “Mɛ ɖé ɖo gǔdo ce jǎwe; mɛ énɛ́ ɔ́ hú gǎn mì, bɔ un nyí mɛɖé bó sixú fɛ, bó tún afɔkpakan tɔn lɛ́ɛ vɔ́vɔ́ ǎ. "
"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” ","Nyɛ ɔ́, sin wɛ un sɔ́ dó ɖo yɛhwesin lɛ nú mi wɛ; éyɛ́ ká ná sɔ́ Yɛsinsɛn dó lɛ yɛhwesin nú mi.” "
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. ,"Hwenɛ́nu wɛ Jezu gosín gletoxo e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Nazalɛ́ti é mɛ, ɖo Galilée yíkúngban jí wá, bɔ Jǎan lɛ yɛhwesin n'i ɖo Judɛ́ɛn tɔ ɔ́ mɛ. "
"As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. ","Hwenu e Jezu ɖo tɔ ɔ́ mɛ tɔ́n sín wɛ ɔ́ jǐnukúnsin hun, bɔ Yɛsinsɛn cí ahwannɛ́ ɖɔhun bó wá jɛ te dó jǐ tɔn. "
"And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.” ","Bɔ è se gbe ɖé sín jǐxwé, bɔ é ɖɔ: “Vǐ vívɛ́ná wɛ a nyǐ nú mì, bɔ xomɛ nɔ hun mì dó wǔtu towe tlala.” "
"At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert, ","Énɛ́ gúdo ɔ́, Yɛ ɔ́ nyi Jezu sɛ́ dó gbětótló mɛ. "
"and he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him. ","É nɔ fínɛ́ xɔ azǎn kanɖé (40), bɔ Satáan tɛ́n ɛ kpɔ́n. Gběkanlin lɛ́ɛ tɛ́ntin wɛ é nɔ́ nɔ, bɔ Mawu sín wɛnsagun lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ wá gɔ́ alɔ n'i. "
"After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. ","Ée è wlǐ Jǎan gúdo ɔ́, Jezu yi Galilée, bó jɛ Wɛn Ɖagbe Mawu tɔn jlá mɛ lɛ́ɛ jí, "
"“The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!” ","bó nɔ́ ɖɔ: “Hwe ɔ́ nu ɖíe su e. Axɔ́súɖuɖu Mawu tɔn kó sɛ yá. Mi lɛ́ kɔ sín hwɛ mitɔn lɛ́ɛ gúdo, bó ɖi nǔ nú Wɛn Ɖagbe Mawu tɔn.” "
"As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. ","Jezu ka ɖo Galilée tɔ ɔ́ tó gbɔn wɛ, bó mɔ Sinmɔ́ɔ kpódó nɔví tɔn Andlé kpán ɖo ɖɔ nyi wɛ ɖo tɔ ɔ́ jí; ɖó ɖɔnyitɔ́ wɛ nú yě. "
"“Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.” ","Jezu ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi xwedó mì. Un ná ná kplɔ́n mi, bɔ mi ná nɔ́ dɔn gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, lě e mi nɔ nyi ɖɔ dó wlí hweví gbɔn é.” "
At once they left their nets and followed him. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, yě jó ɖɔ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ dó tlóló, bó xwedó e. "
"When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets. ","Ée Jezu ná lɛ́ sɛ yi nukɔn kpɛɖé ɔ́, é mɔ Zebeɖée ví we: Jaki kpódó Jǎan kpán, bɔ yě ɖo tɔjíhún mɛ, bó ɖo ɖɔ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ blóɖó wɛ, "
"Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him. ","bɔ Jezu ylɔ́ yě tlóló, bɔ yě jó tɔ́ yětɔn Zebeɖée ɔ́ dó nyi tɔjíhún ɔ́ mɛ kpódó azɔ̌watɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpán, lobo xwedó e. "
"They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach. ","Jezu kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó yi Kafaanawúmu; gbɔjɛzán Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn gbe ɔ́, é byɔ́ kplɔ́ngbasá, bó jɛ nǔ kplɔ́n mɛ jí. "
"The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law. ","Nǔkplɔ́nmɛ tɔn nɔ kpácá yě mɛ e ɖo tó ɖó e wɛ lɛ́ɛ, ɖó é nɔ kplɔ́n nǔ mɛ kpódó acɛkpikpa kpán; é cí sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔhun ǎ. "
"Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out, ","Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, dǎwe ɖé ɖo kplɔ́ngbasá ɔ́, bɔ yɛ nyanya ɖo jǐ tɔn; é sú xó, bó ɖɔ: "
"“What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are–the Holy One of God!” ","“Étɛ́ wɛ mǐ kpó hwi kpó kpédó, Jezu Nazalɛ́tinu? Kún mǐtɔn sú dó gbé wɛ a ja bo wá a? Un tunwun mɛ e a nyǐ é; mɛ mímɛ́ Mawu tɔn wɛ a nyǐ.” "
“Be quiet!” said Jesus sternly. “Come out of him!” ,"Jezu ka bɛ́ adǎn dó jǐ tɔn ɖɔ: “Nɔ abwɛ̌, bó gosín dǎwe élɔ́ jí.” "
The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek. ,"Bɔ yɛ nyanya ɔ́ húnhún dǎwe ɔ́ syɛ́nsyɛ́n, bó gosín jǐ tɔn, lobo sú xó ɖaxó ɖé. "
"The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, “What is this? A new teaching–and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him.” ","É kpácá yě bǐ bɔ yě nɔ́ kanbyɔ́ yěɖée ɖɔ: “Ani ka ɖíe? Nǔkplɔ́nmɛ alɔkpa vo ɖíe mɛ! É nɔ́ ɖe gbe dó yɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ, kpódó acɛkpikpa kpán, bɔ yě nɔ́ se gbe n'i.” "
News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee. ,"Azɔn ɖokpó ɔ́, nyǐkɔ tɔn gba kpé Galilée gbé ɔ́ bǐ jí. "
"As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. ","Ée Jezu tɔ́n sín kplɔ́ngbasá Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn ɔ́, é kpódó Jaki kpó, kpódó Jǎan kpán wá yi Sinmɔ́ɔ kpódó Andlé kpán sín xwé gbe. "
"Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her. ","Avivɔ ka ɖo Sinmɔ́ɔ sín asinɔ jí, bɔ é ɖo ayǐmlɔ́mlɔ́; ée Jezu wá lě tlóló ɔ́, yě ɖɔ xó tɔn nú Jezu. "
"So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them. ","Jezu sɛ yá azinzɔnnɔ ɔ́, bó hɛn alɔ tɔn, bó sɔ́ ɛ sí te; tlóló ɔ́, avivɔ ɔ́ kɔ́n n'i, bɔ é jɛ jǒnɔ yětɔn yí jí. "
That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed. ,"Gbadanu hwenu e hwe ɖo xɔ yi wɛ ɔ́, è kplá azinzɔnnɔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ, kpódó mɛ e jí yɛ nyanya ɖe lɛ́ɛ kpó wá nú Jezu, "
"The whole town gathered at the door, ",bɔ to ɔ́ bǐ sésé wá kplé ɖo xwé e gbe Jezu ɖe ɔ́ sín hɔntogbó jí. 
"and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was. ","Jezu gbɔ azɔn tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ nú azinzɔnnɔ gěgé, bó nya yɛ nyanya gěgé. É ka lɔn nú yɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ ní ɖɔ xó ǎ, ɖó yě tunwun mɛ e é nyí ɔ́. "
"Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed. ","Jezu fɔ́n zǎn ayǐtéhɔ̌nnu, bó tɔ́n yi fí e mɛɖé ma ná dó tagba n'i ɖe ǎ é, bó xo ɖɛ ɖo fínɛ́. "
"Simon and his companions went to look for him, ",Sinmɔ́ɔ kpódó gbɛ̌ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó ká jɛ gbě tɔn mɛ. 
"and when they found him, they exclaimed: “Everyone is looking for you!” ","Hwenu e yě wá yi mɔ ɛ ɔ́, yě ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ ɖo biba we wɛ.” "
"Jesus replied, “Let us go somewhere else–to the nearby villages–so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.” ","É ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi nú mǐ ná gosín fí bó ná yi to e sɛkpɔ́ fí lɛ́ɛ mɛ, nú má yi jlá Mawuxó ɖo fí énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌, ɖó nǔ e wú un tɔ́n é nɛ́.” "
"So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons. ","Bɔ é gbɔn Galilée to ɔ́ bǐ mɛ, bó nɔ́ jlá Mawuxó ɖo kplɔ́ngbasá lɛ́ɛ, bó nɔ́ nya yɛ nyanya sín mɛ lɛ́ɛ jí. "
"A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, “If you are willing, you can make me clean.” ","Nya gudunɔ ɖé wá Jezu gɔ́n, bó jɛ kpo ɖo nukɔn tɔn, bó ɖɔ: “Nú é jló we ɔ́, a hɛn ɔ́, a nǎ gbɔ azɔn nú mì.” "
"Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!” ","Nǔ tɔn ka blá wǔ nú Jezu, bɔ é dlɛ́n alɔ, bó ɖó wǔ tɔn bó ɖɔ: “Un jló, azɔn towe ní gbɔ.” "
Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured. ,"Tlóló ɔ́, azɔn tɔn gbɔ, bɔ wútu tɔn jɛ te. "
Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning: ,"Jezu ɖɔ xó n'i kpódó adǎn kpó ɖɔ: “Đǒtó mì ganjí! Ma ɖɔ nú mɛɖé ó; lo ɔ́, sɔ́ lě e a ɖe ɔ́ yi xlɛ́ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, bó ná wǔsláslá sín agban e xó Mɔyízi ɖɔ ɔ́, bónú yě ná dó tunwun ɖɔ azɔn towe gbɔ nǔgbó.” Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, é nyi i. "
"Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home. ","Lo ɔ́, ée nya énɛ́ ɔ́ ɖidó ɔ́, é jɛ nǔ e Jezu wa n'i ɔ́ jlá jí gbɔn fí bǐ; énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ Jezu ma sɔ́ sixú yi toxo ɖé mɛ ǎ.

"So many gathered that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them. ","bó nyi ahwan yi kplé ɖo fínɛ́, bɔ tɛn ján káká yi hɔnto. Jezu nɔ ɖo Mawuxó ɖɔ nú yě wɛ. "
"Some men came, bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them. ","Mɛ ɖé lɛ́ɛ wá gɔ̌n tɔn, bɔ mɛ ɛnɛ ɖo yě mɛ, bó hɛn ayǐsónɔ ɖokpó wá gɔ̌n tɔn. "
"Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging through it, lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on. ","Ée ahwan ɔ́ sukpɔ́ káká, bɔ yě ma sixú sɛkpɔ́ ɛ ǎ é ɔ́, yě gbɔ bó xá xɔ e mɛ Jezu ɖe ɔ́ ta, bó kɔ́n xɔ ɔ́ ɖo akpá e xwé Jezu ɖe ɔ́, bó zé ayǐsónɔ ɔ́, kpódó zan e jí é ɖe ɔ́ kpó gbɔn fínɛ́ yi jɛ Jezu sín asá mɛ.

"When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.” ","Ée Jezu mɔ lě e yě ɖi nǔ sɔ ɔ́, é ɖɔ nú ayǐsónɔ ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Vǐ ce, è sɔ́ hwɛ towe lɛ́ɛ kɛ we.” "
"Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves, ","Sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ ɖé lɛ́ɛ ká ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n ɖo mɛ lɛ́ɛ mɛ, bó jɛ ɖiɖɔ dó xomɛ jí ɖɔ: "
“Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” ,“Nɛ̌ nya élɔ́ sixú ɖɔ nǔ mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn gbɔn? Nu nylá dó Mawu wú wɛ é ɖe. Mɛ̌ wɛ ká sixú sɔ́ hwɛ kɛ mɛ zɛ Mawu ɖokpónɔ wú?” 
"Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, “Why are you thinking these things? ","Ée Jezu wɔ́ tlóló ɖɔ yě ɖo xó mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn ɖɔ dó xomɛ wɛ ɔ́, é kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Aniwú wɛ mi ka ɖo nǔ mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn lɛ́ɛ lin wɛ? "
"Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, take your mat and walk’? ","Ényí è ɖɔ nú ayǐsónɔ ɖɔ: ‘È sɔ́ hwɛ towe lɛ́ɛ kɛ we,’ abǐ, ‘Sí te, sɔ́ zan towe bo ɖi zɔnlin’ ɔ́, ɖě tɛ́ wɛ ká bɔkun hú ɖě? "
"But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins . . . .” He said to the paralytic, ","Lo ɔ́, un jló ɖɔ mi ní tunwun ɖɔ nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ ɖó acɛ e sɔ́ hwɛ kɛ mɛ ɖo ayǐkúngban jí é”. Ée é ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, é ɖɔ nú "
"“I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.” ","ayǐsónɔ ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Un ɖe gbe nú we, sí te, sɔ́ zan towe, bó yi xwé.” "
"He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!” ","Azɔn ɖokpó ɔ́, nya ɔ́ sí te, bó sɔ́ zan tɔn, bó ɖi zɔnlin, bó tɔ́n ɖo yě bǐ nukún mɛ, bɔ ahwi xo yě bǐ; bɔ yě jɛ Mawu xomlá jí, bó nɔ́ ɖɔ: “Mǐ kó mɔ nǔ lěhunkɔtɔn kpɔ́n gbeɖé ǎ.” "
"Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them. ","Jezu lɛ́ yi Galilée tɔ ɔ́ tó, bɔ mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ nɔ́ wá gɔ̌n tɔn, bɔ é nɔ ɖo nǔ kplɔ́n yě wɛ. "
"As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. “Follow me,” Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him. ","Ée Jezu ɖidó ɔ́, é mɔ Levíi Alufée ví ɔ́ ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n ɖo denuzɔ́watɔ́ lɛ́ɛ xɔsá, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Xwedó mì.” Bɔ é sí te, bó xwedó e. "
"While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and “sinners” were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. ","Jezu ka wá ɖo nǔ ɖu wɛ ɖo Levíi xwé, bɔ tokwɛ́yítɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpódó hwɛhutɔ́ gěgé kpán ɖo nǔ ɖu xá é kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó wɛ, ɖó yě sukpɔ́ bó xwedó e. "
"When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the “sinners” and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: “Why does he eat with tax collectors and ‘sinners’?” ","Ée sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ e ɖo Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ sín ahwan mɛ lɛ́ɛ mɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě kanbyɔ́ ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Aniwú é ká nɔ́ ɖu nǔ xá hwɛhutɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpódó tokwɛ́yítɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpó?” "
"On hearing this, Jesus said to them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.” ","Ée Jezu se mɔ̌ ɔ́, é ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mɛ e ɖo ganjí lɛ́ɛ wɛ azɔngblétɔ́ nú hudó ǎ; lo ɔ́, mɛ e ɖo azɔn jɛ wɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ nǔ tɔn hudó.

"Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, “How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?” ","Jǎan sín ahwanvú lɛ́ɛ kpódó mawusɛntɔ́gbɛ́ e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ kpán nɔ́ ɖo nu blá wɛ, bɔ mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ wá kanbyɔ́ Jezu ɖɔ: “Aniwú wɛ Jǎan sín ahwanvú lɛ́ɛ kpódó ahwanvú Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ tɔn kpó ká nɔ́ ɖo nu blá wɛ, bɔ ahwanvú towe lɛ́ɛ ma ka nɔ́ blá ɖě ǎ?” "
"Jesus answered, “How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them. ",Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Asisúnɔ ɔ́ sín xɔ́ntɔn lɛ́ɛ sixú blá nu hwenu e asisúnɔ ɔ́ kpo ɖo kpɔ́ xá yě ɔ́ a? Nǔ sixú nyí mɔ̌ ǎ
"But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast. ","Amɔ̌, é ná wá su hweɖénu, bɔ è nǎ wá sɔ́ ɛ sín yě gɔ́n; hwe énɛ́ ɔ́ nu wɛ yě ná blá nu. "
"“No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.

"And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, he pours new wine into new wineskins.” ","Mɛ ɖé ka nɔ́ sɔ́ vɛ̌ɛn yɔ̌yɔ́ kɔn dó anyǔglo xóxó mɛ ǎ, ɖó ényí è blǒ mɔ̌ ɔ́, vɛ̌ɛn ɔ́ ná hɛn anyǔglo ɔ́ wú, bɔ vɛ̌ɛn ɔ́ kpódó anyǔglo ɔ́ kpó bǐ ná lá mɛ; lo ɔ́, vɛ̌ɛn yɔ̌yɔ́ ɔ́, anyǔglo yɔ̌yɔ́ mɛ wɛ è nɔ kɔn dó.” "
"One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.

"The Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?” ",Bɔ Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Kpɔ́n! Étɛ́wú wɛ ahwanvú towe lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ wa nǔ e sɛ́n mǐtɔn gbɛ́ ɖɔ è ma wa gbɔjɛzán gbe ó é?”

"In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat.

"Then he said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. ",É lɛ́ ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Gbɛtɔ́ wútu wɛ è ɖǒ gbɔjɛzán ɔ́
"So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”Another time he went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ kpa acɛ dó gbɔjɛzán ɔ́ lɔmɔ̌ nu.”Jezu lɛ́ wá yi kplɔ́ngbasá ɔ́, bɔ nya ɖé ɖo fínɛ́, bɔ alɔ tɔn kú. "

"Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, “Stand up in front of everyone.” ",Jezu ka ɖɔ nú nya e sín alɔ kú ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Sí te bó wá jɛ tɛ́ntin fí.” 
"Then Jesus asked them, “Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” But they remained silent.

"He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.

Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus. ,"Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ tɔ́n sín kplɔ́ngbasá ɔ́, bɔ tlóló ɔ́, yě yi mɔ toxóɖɔgbɛ́ axɔ́sú Elódu tɔn, bɔ yě kplé, bó ɖe wě dó lě e yě nǎ bló gbɔn, bó hu Jezu ɔ́ wú. "
"Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed. ","Jezu kpódó ahwanvú lɛ́ɛ kpó sɛ́ jɛ Judɛ́ɛn tɔ ɔ́ tó; mɛ gěgé nyi ahwan sín Galilée, sín Judée, sín Jeluzalɛ́mu, kpódó Idumɛ́ɛ kpan; sín Tíi kpódó Sidɔ́ɔn kpán gbé jí, bó jɛ gǔdo tɔn, ɖó yě se nǔ e wa wɛ é ɖe lɛ́ɛ.

"Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him. ","É ká zɔ́n ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ yě ní sɔ́ tɔjíhún ɖokpó ɖó te nú émí, bónú mɛ lɛ́ɛ ma wá nyɛ́sú émí ó. "
"For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him. ","Đó, azɔn e gbɔ nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ é ɖe ɔ́ zɔ́n, bɔ azinzɔnnɔ lɛ́ɛ nɔ ba ná ɖó alɔ wǔtu tɔn, bónú azɔn yětɔn ná gbɔ. "
"Whenever the evil spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God.” ","Yɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ mɔ ɛ hweɖěbǔnu ɔ́, yě nɔ́ ɖe kɔ́ n'i, bó nɔ́ sú xó ɖɔ: “Mawu ví wɛ a nyǐ!” "
But he gave them strict orders not to tell who he was. ,"Lo ɔ́, Jezu nɔ gbɛ́ nú yě kpódó adǎn kpó ɖɔ yě ma ɖɔ mɛ e émí nyí ɔ́ nú mɛɖé se ó. "
"Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him. ","Jezu ka xá só jí, bó ylɔ́ mɛ e jló e lɛ́ɛ, bɔ yě yi gɔ̌n tɔn; "
He appointed twelve–designating them apostles–that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach ,"bɔ é cyán mɛ wěwe ɖo yě mɛ bónú yě ná nɔ kpɔ́ xá ɛ, nú é ná nɔ sɛ́ yě dó Mawuxó jlá gbé, "
and to have authority to drive out demons. ,"bó ná ná acɛ yě, nú yě ná dó nya yɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ ná. "
These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter),Fon
"James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder); ","Jaki kpódó nɔví tɔn Jǎan kpó, Zebeɖée ví wɛ yě nyǐ, bɔ (Jezu sun nyǐ yě ɖɔ Boanɛɛgɛ́si, tínmɛ tɔn wɛ nyí “xɛbyosoví.”) "
"Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot ","Andlé, Filípu, Baatelemíi, Matíe, Tɔmáa, Jaki Alufée ví ɔ́, Tadée, Sinmɔ́ɔ hunjɛdótojítɔ́ ɔ́, "
"and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. ",kpódó Judási Isikaliɔ́ti e wá jó Jezu ɔ́ kpó. 
"Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat. ","Jezu ka wá xwé gbe, bɔ mɛ gěgé lɛ́ wá kplé ɖo fínɛ́, káká bɔ é kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpán sɔ́ mɔ tɛn ná ɖu nǔ ǎ. "
"When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, “He is out of his mind.” ","Ée mɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ se mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě wá bó ná kplá ɛ, ɖó yě ɖo ɖiɖɔ wɛ ɖɔ ta tɔn mɛ kún sɔ́ sɔgbe ó. "
"And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beelzebub! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons.” ",Sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ e gosín Jeluzalɛ́mu wá lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ ɖo ɖiɖɔ wɛ ɖɔ: “Bɛluzebúlu (yɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ xɔ́sú) wɛ ɖo jǐ tɔn
So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables: “How can Satan drive out Satan? ,"Jezu ka ylɔ́ yě wá, bó dó lǒ dó ɖɔ xó nú yě ɖɔ: “Nɛ̌ Satáan ka sixú nya é ɖésúnɔ gbɔn? "
"If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. ","Axɔ́súɖuto ɖé ma ɖó gbe kpɔ́ ǎ ɔ́, to énɛ́ ɔ́ sixú jínjɔ́n ayǐ ǎ. "
"If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. ","Ényí xwé ɖé tíin, bónú mɛ e ɖ'é mɛ lɛ́ɛ sín gbe ma ɖo kpɔ́ ǎ ɔ́, xwé énɛ́ ɔ́, gba wɛ é nɔ gba. "
"And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come. ","Ényí Satáan gbɛ́ wǎn nú éɖée ɔ́, axɔ́súɖuto tɔn ná klán, bó ná sixú nɔ te ǎ, bɔ acɛkpikpa tɔn vɔ nɛ́. "
"In fact, no one can enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can rob his house. ","“Mɛ ɖé sixú yi súnnu glegbenu ɖé xwé, bó fɔ nǔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ ma tó blá ɛ hwɛ̌ ǎ; lo ɔ́, ényí é blá ɛ ɔ́, é ná fɔ nǔ e ɖo xwé tɔn gbe lɛ́ɛ é bǐ. "
"I tell you the truth, all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them. ",“Ma ɖɔ nǔgbó nú mi: hwɛ e gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kó sixú hu ɔ́ kpódó nu e yě kó sixú nylá dó Mawu wú ɔ́ kpó bǐ wɛ Mawu ná sɔ́ kɛ yě. 
But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven,Fon
"He said this because they were saying, “He has an evil spirit.” ",Jezu ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɖó yě ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ yɛ nyanya wɛ ɖo jǐ tɔn. 
"Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him. ","Jezu sín nɔví lɛ́ɛ kpódó nɔ yětɔn kpán cí hɔnto, lobo sɛ́ mɛ dó ɖɔ yě ní yi ylɔ́ Jezu wá nú émí. "
"A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, “Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you.” ","Mɛ gěgé ka ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó e, bɔ è wá ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Kpɔ́n! Nɔ towe kpódó nɔví towe lɛ́ɛ kpó ɖo hɔnto, bó ɖo biba we wɛ.” "
“Who are my mother and my brothers?” he asked. ,É ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌ ká nyí nɔ ce? Mɛ̌ ká nyí nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ?” 
"Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, “Here are my mother and my brothers! ","Bɔ é nyi nukún kpɔ́n mɛ e ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó e lɛ́ɛ, bó ɖɔ: “Nɔ ce kpódó nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ kpán ɖíe. "
"Whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother.”Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water's edge. ","Mɛ ɖěbǔ e ko sixú bló jlǒ Mawu tɔn ɔ́, mɛ énɛ́ ɔ́ wɛ nyí nɔví ce súnnu, bó nyí nɔví ce nyɔ̌nu, bó nyí nɔ ce.”Jezu lɛ́ wá jɛ nǔ kplɔ́n mɛ lɛ́ɛ jí ɖo Galilée sín tɔ ɔ́ tó.

"He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said: ","É dó lǒ dó kplɔ́n nǔ gěgé yě. Hwenu e é ka ɖo nǔ kplɔ́n yě wɛ ɔ́, é ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: "
“Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed. ,"“Mi ɖótó! Glesi ɖé tɔ́n gbe ɖokpó, bó yi nǔkún hú gbé. "
"As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. ","Hwenu e é ɖo nǔkún ɔ́ hú gbɔn gle ɔ́ mɛ wɛ ɔ́, nǔkún lɛ́ɛ ɖě jɛ ali jí, bɔ xɛ lɛ́ɛ wá cyán ɖu. "
"Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. ","Đě wá jɛ awǐnnyakan mɛ fí e kɔ́ gěgé ɖé ma ɖe ǎ é; énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ yá wǔ wú, ɖó kɔ́ sukpɔ́ ɖo fínɛ́ ǎ. "
"But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. ","Lo ɔ́, ée hwesivɔ́ wá hun ɔ́, yě fyɔ́, lobo xú; ɖó ɖɔ yětɔn yi do ǎ. "
"Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain. ","Đěvo lɛ́ jɛ wundonu, bɔ wun lɛ́ɛ wú, bó vun blá yě, bɔ yě sɔ́ sɛ́n ǎ. "
"Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, multiplying thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times.” ","Đěvo lɛ́ jɛ ayǐkúngban ɖagbe jí bó wú, bó hwán, bɔ nǔkún ɖokpó ná mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn donu gban (30), ɖě ná mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn donu kanɖé ko (60), ɖě ná mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn donu kanwe ko (100).” "
"Then Jesus said, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.” ",Jezu lɛ́ ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mɛ e ɖó tó bó ná dó se nǔ ɔ́ ní ɖótó bó se.” 
"When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables. ","Hwenu e Jezu wá ɖo vo ɔ́, mɛ e lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó e lɛ́ɛ kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó ɖɔ é ní tín lǒ lɛ́ɛ mɛ nú émí. "
"He told them, “The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables ","É ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Axɔ́súɖuɖu Mawu tɔn sín nǔbúdo lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ Mawu hun xlɛ́, amɔ̌, mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, lǒ mɛ wɛ è nǎ ɖɔ bǐ dó nú yě. "
"so that, “ ‘they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!’ ” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, ‘Yě ná mɔ, cóbó ka ná dán ɛ; yě ná se, yě ka ná mɔ nǔ jɛ mɛ ǎ. Đó yě táá wá lɛ́ kɔ sín hwɛ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ gúdo, nú Mawu ná wá sɔ́ hwɛ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ kɛ yě.’ ” "
"Then Jesus said to them, “Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable? ","Jezu ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Ényí mi ma mɔ nukúnnú jɛ lǒ élɔ́ mɛ din ǎ ɔ́, nɛ̌ wɛ mi ka sixú mɔ nukúnnú jɛ lǒ lɛ́ɛ bǐ mɛ gbɔn? "
The farmer sows the word. ,Nǔkún e hú wɛ glesi ɔ́ ɖe ɔ́ wɛ nyí Mawuxó ɔ́. 
"Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. ","Ali e jí nǔkún lɛ́ɛ jɛ ɔ́ wɛ nyí mɛ e nɔ se Mawuxó ɔ́, bɔ tlóló ɔ́, Satáan nɔ wá ɖe sín ayi yětɔn mɛ lɛ́ɛ. "
"Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy. ","Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, awǐnnyakan e mɛ nǔkún lɛ́ɛ jɛ ɔ́ wɛ nyí mɛ e nɔ se xó ɔ́, bó nɔ yá wǔ yí kpódó awǎjijɛ kpó lɛ́ɛ, "
"But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. ","lo ɔ́, Mawuxó ɔ́ nɔ́ dó ɖɔ do ɖo ayi yětɔn mɛ ǎ, bɔ hwenu e è nɔ wá ɖo tagba dó nú mɛ wɛ, bó nɔ́ ɖo mɛ ɖe dó wɛ, ɖó Mawuxó ɔ́ wútu ɔ́, nǔɖiɖi yětɔn nɔ́ jɛ ayǐ. "
"Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word; ","Wundonu fí e nǔkún lɛ́ɛ jɛ ɔ́, wɛ nyí yě mɛ e nɔ se Mawuxó ɔ́, "
"but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful. ","bɔ gbɛmɛ fí sín tagba lɛ́ɛ, dɔkun gbɛmɛ fí tɔn lɛ́ɛ sín mɛdindɔn kpódó nukúnkɛn alɔkpa alɔkpa lɛ́ɛ kpó nɔ́ wá vun blá, bó nɔ́ hu xó ɔ́ ɖo ayi yětɔn mɛ, bɔ é nɔ gɔn sínsɛ́n é. "
"Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop–thirty, sixty or even a hundred times what was sown.” ","Ayǐkúngban ɖagbe e jí nǔkún lɛ́ɛ jɛ ɔ́ wɛ nyí mɛ e nɔ se Mawuxó ɔ́, bó nɔ́ hɛn dó ayi mɛ, bɔ é nɔ wa azɔ̌ ɖo gbɛzán yětɔn mɛ, bɔ nǔɖiɖi yětɔn nɔ́ gba kún lɛ́ɛ; ényí nǔkún ɖé wɛ yě nyǐ ɔ́, ɖě ná ná sínsɛ́n mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn donu gban (30), ɖě ná ná mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn donu kanɖé ko (60), bɔ ɖěvo ná ná mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn donu kanwe ko (100) mɔ̌.” "
"He said to them, “Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don't you put it on its stand? ","Jezu lɛ́ wá ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “È tá zogbɛ́n ɔ́, zɛ̌n glɔ́ abǐ akánma glɔ́ wɛ è nɔ sɔ́ dó a? É má nyí nǔ ta aga wɛ è nɔ sɔ́ ɖó ǎ cé? "
"For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open. ","Đó nǔ ɖěbǔ ɖo nǔglɔ́, bó ná gɔn agbawungba jɛ ǎ. Nǔ ɖěbǔ ka nɔ wi mɛ káká ɔ́, é ná wá jɛ wěxo. "
"If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.” ",Mɛ e ɖó tó bó ná dó se nǔ ɔ́ ní ɖótó bó se.” 
"“Consider carefully what you hear,” he continued. “With the measure you use, it will be measured to you–and even more. ","Jezu lɛ́ ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi hɛn ayi dó nǔ e se wɛ mi ɖe lɛ́ɛ wú, ɖó nǔjlɛ́nú e mi nɔ dó jlɛ́ nǔ ná ɔ́ wɛ è nǎ dó jlɛ́ nǔ nú mi, bó ná lɛ́ xú nú mi. "
"Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.” ","Đó, mɛ e ɖó nǔ ɔ́, Mawu ná lɛ́ ná ɛ, bɔ é ná sukpɔ́ d'é jí; mɛ e ma ka ɖó nǔɖé ǎ ɔ́, Mawu ná lɛ́ yí kpɛ e é ɖó ɔ́ sín así tɔn.” "
"He also said, “This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground. ","Jezu ka lɛ́ yí xó, bó ɖɔ: “Axɔ́súɖuto Mawu tɔn cí nya e dó nǔkún ɖo gle mɛ ɔ́ ɖɔhun. "
"Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. ","Zǎn kú ɔ́, nya énɛ́ ɔ́ nɔ́ dɔ́ amlɔ; ayǐ hɔ́n ɔ́, é nɔ́ fɔ́n; lě e é ka nyí gbɔn káká bɔ nǔkún ɔ́ wú bó ɖo susu wɛ ɔ́, é mɔ do ná ǎ. "
"All by itself the soil produces grain–first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head. ","Ayǐkúngban ɔ́ ɖésú wɛ nɔ́ ná jinukún; ama ɔ́ wɛ nɔ́ zɔ́n jɛ nukɔn; énɛ́ gúdo ɔ́, é nɔ́ gba sɛ́, bó nɔ́ fɔ vǐ hwɛ̌ cóbó nɔ́ wá ɖó kwín. "
"As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.” ","Jinukún ka wá su yiya ɔ́, glenɔ ɔ́ nɔ́ bɔ nǔkún-yanú nyi mɛ, ɖó nǔkún-yahwenu su.” "
"Again he said, “What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it? ",Jezu ka lɛ́ ɖɔ: “Étɛ́wú mǐ ná jlɛ́ axɔ́súɖuto Mawu tɔn dó? Abǐ lǒ tɛ́ wɛ mǐ ná dó bó ná dó ɖɔ xó d'é wú? 
"It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest seed you plant in the ground. ",Axɔ́súɖuto Mawu tɔn ɔ́ cí atínkwín e wínní hú ɖě lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɔ́ ɖɔhun. 
"Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds of the air can perch in its shade.” ","Ényí è ka dó, bónú é wá wú ɔ́, atín tɔn nɔ́ wá yi jǐ hú atín ɖě lɛ́ɛ bǐ. É nɔ́ zɛ ala ɖaxó ɖaxó lɛ́ɛ, káká bɔ xɛ lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ wa adɔ̌ nyi ama tɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ.” "
"With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand. ","Lǒ mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ wɛ Jezu nɔ dó bó nɔ́ dó jlá Mawuxó ɔ́ yě, lě e yě sixú mɔ nukúnnú jɛ mɛ gbɔn é. "
"He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything. ","É ɖɔ xó ɖěbǔ nú yě ma gɔn lǒ dó ǎ; lo ɔ́, nú é kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó wá ɖo vo ɔ́, é nɔ́ tín lǒ lɛ́ɛ bǐ mɛ nú yě. "
"That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, “Let us go over to the other side.” ","Gbe nɛ́ gbe ɖokpó ɔ́, ée gbadanu wá su ɔ́, Jezu ɖɔ nú ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Mi nú mǐ ná yi agě ɖě ɔ́ jǐ.” "
"Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him. ","Bɔ ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ byɔ́ tɔjíhún e mɛ é ɖésúnɔ ko ɖe ɖ'ayǐ é mɛ, bɔ yě jó ahwan ɔ́ dó, bó kun i ɖidó. Tɔjíhún ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ kpó e kpó ka ɖidó. "
"A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped. ","Tlóló kpowun ɔ́, jɔhɔn ɖaxó ɖé jɛ́n jɛ nyinyi jí, bó nɔ́ xo sin dó tɔjíhún ɔ́ mɛ, káká bɔ tɔjíhún ɔ́ jɛ gǐgɔ́ jí. "
"Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, “Teacher, don't you care if we drown?” ","Jezu ka zé ta ɖó kɔɖónú ɖé jí ɖo gǔdo, bó ɖo amlɔ dɔ́ wɛ. Ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ká yi fɔ́n ɛ, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌si, mǐ ɖo tɔ ná kú wɛ, é ɖɔ nǔɖé nú we ǎ cé?” "
"He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, “Quiet! Be still!” Then the wind died down and it was completely calm. ","Jezu ka fɔ́n, bó ɖe gbe dó jɔhɔn ɔ́, bó ɖɔ nú xu ɔ́ ɖɔ ní hwíhwɛ́, bɔ jɔhɔn ɔ́ xwɛ, bɔ fí bǐ cí tóó. "
"He said to his disciples, “Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?” ",Bɔ é wá kanbyɔ́ ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Aniwú mi ka ɖo xɛsi ɖi wɛ sɔ mɔ̌? Mi ɖó nǔɖiɖi ǎ cé?” 
"They were terrified and asked each other, “Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!”They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes. ","Xɛsi ɖaxó ɖé jɛ ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ jí, bɔ yě jɛ kinkanbyɔ́ yěɖée jí ɖɔ: “Mɛ nǎhún wɛ ká nyí nya élɔ́, bɔ jɔhɔn kpódó xu kpó nɔ́ se gbe n'i?”Jezu kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó dó asá Galilée tɔ ɔ́, bó yi Jelazáanu lɛ́ɛ sín ayǐkúngban jí.

"When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an evil spirit came from the tombs to meet him. ","Ée Jezu jɛ te sín tɔjíhún ɔ́ mɛ tlóló ɔ́, dǎwe ɖé wá kpé e; dǎwe énɛ́ ɔ́, yɛ nyanya ɖo jǐ tɔn, bɔ é tɔ́n sín sóxo mɛ. "
"This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him any more, not even with a chain. ","Sóxo mɛ fínɛ́ wɛ nya énɛ́ ɔ́ nɔ́ nɔ, bɔ mɛɖé sɔ́ nɔ sixú blá ɛ ǎ; è nǎ bó zé wlɔ ɔ́, è nɔ sixú kpé wú ǎ. "
"For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him. ","Đó azɔn mɔ̌kpán wɛ è ko dó gan afɔ n'i, bó ko dó gɛdɛ ɛ, có é hɛn nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ̌n, bɔ mɛ ɖěbǔ nɔ́ sixú kpé jǐ tɔn ǎ. "
Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones. ,"É nɔ ɖo yɔdo lɛ́ɛ tɛ́ntin zǎn kéze, bó nɔ́ ɖo sóklɛ́nmɛ sóklɛ́nmɛ gbɔn wɛ, bó nɔ́ ɖo xó sú wɛ, bó nɔ́ ɖo awǐnnya sɔ́ tlɛ́n wǔ nú éɖée wɛ. "
"When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him. ","Hwenu e é mɔ Jezu sɛ́ dó ɔ́, é kán wezun yi gɔ̌n tɔn, bó jɛ kpo ɖo nukɔn tɔn, bó ɖe kɔ́ n'i, "
"He shouted at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you won't torture me!” ","bó sú xó, bó ɖɔ: “Étɛ́ wɛ nyɛ kpódó hwi kpán kpédó, Jezu Mawu Ajalɔ̌nlɔn ví? Un sɔ́ Mawu ɖó afɔ nú we, ma dó ya nú mì ó.” "
"For Jesus had said to him, “Come out of this man, you evil spirit!” ","(É ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɖó Jezu ɖe gbe dó e ɖɔ: “Hwi yɛ nyanya élɔ́, gosín nya élɔ́ jí!”) "
"Then Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” “My name is Legion,” he replied, “for we are many.” ","Jezu ka kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Nɛ̌ wɛ nyǐkɔ towe nɔ́ nyí?” Bɔ é yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “ ‘Ahwan’, ɖó mǐ mɛ gěgé wɛ.” "
And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area. ,Bɔ é jɛ vo sa nú Jezu jí ma gbokɔ ɖɔ ní ma nya émí sín gbějí fí ó. 
A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside. ,"Aglǔzahwan ɖaxó ɖé ka ɖo só ɔ́ jí fínɛ́, bó ɖo nǔ ba ɖu wɛ. "
"The demons begged Jesus, “Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.” ","Bɔ yɛ nyanya énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ dó kɛnklɛ́n nú Jezu ɖɔ: “Nǎ gbe mǐ, bónú mǐ ní yi byɔ́ aglǔza énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ mɛ.” "
"He gave them permission, and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned. ","Bɔ Jezu ná gbe yě, bɔ yě gosín dǎwe ɔ́ jí, bó yi byɔ́ aglǔza lɛ́ɛ mɛ, bɔ aglǔza lɛ́ɛ nyi agbo kɔn nyi xu mɛ. Yě bǐ kplékplé ná yi afɔwó (2.000) mɔ̌ bɔ yě bǐ kútɔ. "
"Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. ","Ée aglǔzanyitɔ́ lɛ́ɛ mɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě hɔn bó yi ɖɔ nǔ e jɛ lɛ́ɛ nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖo toxo ɔ́ kpódó gletoxo lɛ́ɛ kpó mɛ, bɔ mɛ lɛ́ɛ wá kpɔ́n nǔ e jɛ ɔ́. "
"When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. ","Yě wá Jezu gɔ́n, bó mɔ nya e jí yɛ nyanya wɔ̌buwɔ́bú kó nɔ ɔ́, ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n, bó dó awu, bɔ ayi tɔn wá gbɛ bɔ xɛsi jɛ yě jí. "
Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man–and told about the pigs as well. ,"Yě mɛ e mɔ lě e nǔ lɛ́ɛ jɛ dó yɛnyanyanɔ ɔ́ kpódó aglǔza lɛ́ɛ kpán jí gbɔn ɔ́, wlǐ bǐ ɖɔ nú yě, bɔ xɛsi jɛ yě jí. "
Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region. ,Bɔ yě jɛ vo sa nú Jezu jí ɖɔ é ní gosín ayǐkúngban émítɔn jí. 
"As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him. ","Hwenu e Jezu ɖo tɔjíhún mɛ byɔ́ wɛ ɔ́, dǎwe e jí é nya yɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ sín ɔ́ sa vo n'i ɖɔ émí ná xwedó e. "
"Jesus did not let him, but said, “Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.” ","Jezu ka gbɛ́, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Yi xwé mɛ towe lɛ́ɛ gɔ́n, bó ɖɔ nǔ e Aklúnɔ wa nú we ɔ́ bǐ nú yě, bó lɛ́ ɖɔ lě e é kú nǔbláwǔ nú we gbɔn ɔ́ bǐ nú yě.” "
So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed. ,"Bɔ nya ɔ́ ɖidó, bó jɛ nǔ e Jezu wá n'i ɔ́ jlá jí, gbɔn tota wǒ lɛ́ɛ gbé jí, bɔ é kpácá mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ. "
"When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake. ","Ée Jezu zɔn tɔjíhún mɛ sín fínɛ́, bó yi jɛ agě ɖě ɔ́ jí ɔ́, é ɖo tɔ ɔ́ tó, bɔ mɛ gěgé ɖé lɛ́ɛ nyi ahwan wá lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó e. "
"Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet ","Jayilɔ́si e nyí gǎn ɖokpó ɖo kplɔ́ngbasá Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn ɔ́ ká wá xwetɔ́n, bó jɛ kpo ɖo Jezu nukɔn, bó jɛ kɛnklɛ́n dó n'i jí ɖɔ: "
"and pleaded earnestly with him, “My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live.” ","“Vǐ ce ɖyɔ̌vǐvú ɔ́ ɖo kúdonu; wǎ yi ɖó alɔ jǐ tɔn, bónú azɔn tɔn ná gbɔ, nú é ná gán.” "
So Jesus went with him. A large crowd followed and pressed around him. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, Jezu xwedó e, bɔ mɛ gěgé nyi ahwan jɛ gǔdo tɔn; mɛ lɛ́ɛ sukpɔ́ káká bó ɖo fyɔ́nfyɔ́n ɛ wɛ gbɔn fí bǐ. "
And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years. ,Nǎwe ɖé ka ɖo fínɛ́
"She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse. ","É kó ji ya gbɔn azɔngblétɔ́ mɔ̌kpán xwé, lobo zán akwɛ́ tɔn bǐ dó wǔvɔ́, azɔn tɔn ka fɔ́n tɛgbɛ ɔ́, jijɛ jí wɛ jɛ́n nɔ́ ɖe. "
"When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, ","Ée é se Jezu sín xó ɔ́, é xo agun ɔ́ zlɛ́ gbɔn gǔdo, bó ɖó alɔ Jezu sín awu wú; "
"because she thought, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.” ","ɖó é ɖo ɖiɖɔ dó ayi mɛ wɛ ɖɔ: “Un vɛ́ ko sixú ɖó alɔ awu tɔn wú kpowun ɔ́, azɔn ce ná gbɔ.” "
Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering. ,"Nǔgbó ɔ́, hun e ɖi wɛ é ɖe ɔ́ gbo ɖo tɛndo ɖokpó ɔ́ mɛ; bɔ é mɔ ɖo agbaza mɛ ɖɔ azɔn émítɔn gbɔ. "
"At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched my clothes?” ","Azɔn ɖokpó ɔ́, Jezu mɔ ɖɔ hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n ɖé gosín émí wú, bó lílɛ́ kpan nukɔn mɛ lɛ́ɛ, bó ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌ ka ɖó alɔ awu ce wú?” "
"“You see the people crowding against you,” his disciples answered, “and yet you can ask, ‘Who touched me?’ ” ","Bɔ ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “A mɔ mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖo fyɔ́nfyɔ́n we wɛ gbɔn fí bǐ, bó ká nɔ́ kanbyɔ́ ɖɔ: ‘Mɛ̌ ka ɖó alɔ wǔ ce?’ ” "
But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it. ,Jezu ka ɖo mɛ e wa mɔ̌ ɔ́ ba wɛ ɖo mɛ e lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó e lɛ́ɛ mɛ. 
"Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, xɛsi jɛ nǎwe ɔ́ jí, bɔ é jɛ sísɔ́sísɔ́ jí; ɖó é tunwun nǔ e jɛ ɖo agbaza tɔn mɛ ɔ́, bó gbɔ bó wá jɛ kpo ɖo Jezu nukɔn, bó ɖɔ xó nǔgbó n'i. "
"He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.” ","Jezu ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Vǐ ce, nǔɖiɖi towe zɔ́n, bɔ azɔn towe gbɔ. Yi dó fífá mɛ; azɔn towe ní gbɔ nú we bǐ.” "
"While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. “Your daughter is dead,” they said. “Why bother the teacher any more?” ","Xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ wɛ Jezu ɖe kɛ́ɖɛ́, bɔ mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ gosín kplɔ́ngbaságán ɔ́ xwé, bó wá ɖɔ nú kplɔ́ngbaságán ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Vǐ towe kó kú, étɛ́ sín tagba wɛ a nǎ lɛ́ dó nú mɛ̌si ɔ́?” "
"Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the synagogue ruler, “Don't be afraid; just believe.” ","Jezu ka wlí tó xó e ɖɔ wɛ yě ɖe nɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖěbǔ wú ǎ, bó ká ɖɔ nú kplɔ́ngbaságán Jayilɔ́si ɖɔ: “Ma ɖi xɛsi ó, vɛ̌ kó ɖi nǔ kpowun.” "
"He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James. ","Jezu ka lɔn bónú mɛɖé xwedó e zɛ Piyɛ́ɛ kpódó Jaki kpó, kpódó Jaki nɔví Jǎan kpán wú ǎ. "
"When they came to the home of the synagogue ruler, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly. ","Jezu kpódó mɛ e é cyán nɛ́ lɛ́ɛ kpó sɛkpɔ́ kplɔ́ngbaságán Jayilɔ́si xwé, bɔ yě se mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖo hlǔnhlún wɛ, bó ɖo avǐ ya wɛ, lobo ɖo xó sú wɛ. "
"He went in and said to them, “Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep.” ","Jezu ka byɔ́ xwé ɔ́ gbe, bó kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Étɛ́ sín hlǔnhlún wɛ mi ka ɖe, bó ɖo avǐ ya wɛ sɔ lě? Vǐ ɔ́ ma ká kú nɛ́! Amlɔ dɔ́ wɛ é ɖe.” "
"But they laughed at him. After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was. ","Mɛ lɛ́ɛ ka jɛ kiko e jí; lo ɔ́, é nya yě bǐ tɔ́n, bó kplá vǐtɔ́ ɔ́, vǐnɔ ɔ́, kpódó ahwanvú tɔn e xwedó e lɛ́ɛ kpán, bɔ yě byɔ́ xɔ e mɛ vǐ ɔ́ ɖe ɔ́; "
"He took her by the hand and said to her, “Talitha koum!” (which means, “Little girl, I say to you, get up!” ). ","é ká hɛn vǐ ɔ́ sín alɔ, bó ɖɔ: “Talita, kúmi.” (Tínmɛ tɔn wɛ nyí ɖɔ: “Đyɔ̌vǐ un ɖe gbe nú we; sí te.”) "
Immediately the girl stood up and walked around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished. ,"Azɔn ɖokpó ɔ́, ɖyɔ̌vǐ ɔ́ sí te, bó jɛ zɔnlin ɖi jí, (ɖó é ko ɖó xwe wěwe.) Nǔ énɛ́ nyí nǔɖé, bó kpácá yě tlala. "
"He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples. ","Jezu ka dó sɛ́n nú yě syɛ́nsyɛ́n ɖɔ: “Mɛ ɖé ma se ɖo nu mitɔn ó, mi ka ná nǔɖuɖu i.”Jezu gosín fínɛ́, bó wá yi Nazalɛ́ti, to e mɛ é su ɖe é, bɔ ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ xwedó e. "
"When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. “Where did this man get these things?” they asked. “What's this wisdom that has been given him, that he even does miracles! ","Gbɔjɛzán Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn gbe wá su, bɔ Jezu jɛ nǔ kplɔ́n mɛ lɛ́ɛ jí ɖo kplɔ́ngbasá; xó e ɖɔ wɛ é ɖe ɔ́ kpácá mɛ e ɖo tó ɖó e wɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ, bɔ yě nɔ́ ɖɔ: “Fítɛ́ é ká ba nǔ ɖagbe ɖagbe énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ sín?

"Isn't this the carpenter? Isn't this Mary's son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him. ","Atínkpatɔ́ ɔ́ nɛ́ ǎ cé?

"Jesus said to them, “Only in his hometown, among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honor.” ","Jezu ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mɛ bǐ wɛ nɔ́ sí gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn; to tɔn mɛ nu lɛ́ɛ, hɛ̌nnumɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ, kpódó xwé tɔn gbe nu lɛ́ɛ kpán jɛ́n ma nɔ́ sí i ǎ.” "
"He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. ","Jezu ka sɔ́ jlɛ́ nǔ ɖaxó ɖé ɖo fínɛ́ zɛ azinzɔnnɔ kwín we e jí é ɖó alɔ, bó gbɔ azɔn ná lɛ́ɛ wú ǎ. "
And he was amazed at their lack of faith. Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village. ,"Nǔ e yě ma ɖi n'i ǎ ɔ́ kpácá ɛ, bɔ é gosín fínɛ́, bó yi jɛ nǔ kplɔ́n mɛ lɛ́ɛ jí gbɔn gletoxo e sɛ yá fínɛ́ lɛ́ɛ mɛ. "
"Calling the Twelve to him, he sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits. ","Jezu ylɔ́ ahwanvú tɔn wěwe lɛ́ɛ kplé, bó jɛ yě sɛ́ dó jí webɔ webɔ. É ná yě acɛ bónú yě ná dó kpé yɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ wú. "
"These were his instructions: “Take nothing for the journey except a staff–no bread, no bag, no money in your belts. ","É ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi jɛ ali hǔn, mi ma hɛn nǔ ɖěbǔ zɛ kpogɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó wú ó, mi ma hɛn nǔɖuɖu ó, mi ma hɛn nǔbyɔ́ɖutɔ́glo ó, mi ma hɛn akwɛ́ ó. "
Wear sandals but not an extra tunic. ,"Mi blá afɔkpakan mitɔn lɛ́ɛ, mi ma hɛn awu ɖěvo gɔ́ nú ée ɖo kɔ nú mi é ó. "
"Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town. ","“Mi byɔ́ to ɖé mɛ hǔn, mi nɔ xwé e gbe è nǎ yí jǒnɔ mitɔn ɖe é, káká jɛ hwenu e mi ná gosín to énɛ́ mɛ dó é. "
"And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave, as a testimony against them.” ","Ényí yě ma ka yí mi ɖo to ɖé mɛ ǎ, abǐ yě ma ɖótó xó mitɔn ǎ hǔn, mi xúxú afɔkɔ́ mitɔn, bó tɔ́n sín to ɔ́ mɛ; nǔ énɛ́ ná ɖe xlɛ́ yě ɖɔ hwɛ yětɔn kún nyɔ́ ó.” "
They went out and preached that people should repent. ,"Yě sɔ́ nǔ bó yi, bó jɛ Mawuxó jlá mɛ lɛ́ɛ jí, ɖɔ yě ní lɛ́ kɔ sín hwɛ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ gúdo. "
They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them. ,"Yě nɔ́ nya yɛ nyanya sín mɛ gěgé jí, bó nɔ́ sá ami nú azinzɔnnɔ gěgé, bɔ azɔn yětɔn nɔ́ gbɔ. "
"King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.” ","Axɔ́sú Elódu ka se nǔ e jlɛ́ wɛ Jezu ɖe lɛ́ɛ, ɖó nyǐkɔ tɔn gba kpé fí bǐ.

"Others said, “He is Elijah.” And still others claimed, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago.” ","Lo ɔ́, mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ ɖɔ: “Elíi wɛ.” Mɛ ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ ká nɔ́ ɖɔ: “Gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖě wɛ ɖɔhun.” "
"But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, the man I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!” ","Ée Elódu se nǔ e jlɛ́ wɛ Jezu ɖe nɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, é ɖɔ: “Jǎan ɖěe un gbo ta ná ɔ́ wɛ fɔ́n sín kú.” "
"For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married. ","Elódu énɛ́ ɔ́ wɛ zɔ́n bɔ è wlǐ Jǎan dó gankpá mɛ, ɖó Elodiadi, nɔví tɔn Filípu sín asi e é yí ɔ́ wútu. "
"For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.” ",Đó Jǎan ɖɔ nú Elódu ɖɔ: “Sɛ́n ɔ́ ná gbe we ɖɔ a nǐ yí nɔví towe sín asi ǎ.” 
"So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to, ","Elodiadi ka hɛn Jǎan xomɛ, bó jló ná hu i; lo ɔ́, é mɔ ali tɔn ǎ. "
"because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled; yet he liked to listen to him. ","Elódu nɔ ɖo xɛsi ɖi nú Jǎan wɛ, ɖó é tunwun ɖɔ gbɛtɔ́ hwɛjijɔnɔ wɛ é nyí, bó lɛ́ nyí mɛ mímɛ́.

Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. ,"Ayǐ ɖagbe ɖé ká wá hɔ́n nú Elodiadi, bɔ gbe nɛ́ gbe ɔ́, Elódu ɖo jijizán tɔn sín xwe ɖu wɛ, lobo ylɔ́ gǎn hɔn-yitɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ, ahwangán tɔn lɛ́ɛ, kpódó mɛ nukúnɖéjí Galilée to ɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó ɖɔ yě ní wá ɖu xwe xá émí. "
"When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, “Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you.” ","Elodiadi sín vǐ nyɔ̌nuví ɔ́ ka wá ɖú we, bɔ weɖúɖú tɔn nyɔ́ Elódu kpódó mɛ e ɖo xwe ɖu xá ɛ wɛ lɛ́ɛ kpó sín nukún mɛ, bɔ axɔ́sú Elódu ɖɔ nú vǐ ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Nǔɖé jló we hǔn, byɔ̌ nú má ná we.” "
"And he promised her with an oath, “Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.” ","Bó dó akpá n'i ɖɔ: “Nǔ ɖěbǔ e a ko sixú byɔ́ ɔ́, é ná bo nyí axɔ́súɖuto ce sín vlɔ̌ɖówe ɔ́, un ná ná we.” "
"She went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask for?” “The head of John the Baptist,” she answered. ","Vǐ ɔ́ ká tɔ́n, bó yi kanbyɔ́ nɔ tɔn ɖɔ: “Étɛ́ un ka sixú byɔ́ din?” Bɔ nɔ tɔn yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Byɔ̌ Jǎan Yɛhwesinlɛnúmɛtɔ́ ɔ́ sín ta.” "
At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.” ,"Vǐ ɔ́ ká fyá, bó yi axɔ́sú ɔ́ gɔ́n, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Un jló ɖɔ a nǐ ná Jǎan Yɛhwesinlɛnúmɛtɔ́ sín ta mì dó gannúgbɛ́jɛ́ mɛ ɖo fí din tlóló.” "
"The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her. ","Ée axɔ́sú ɔ́ se mɔ̌ ɔ́, wǔ kú i tlala, amɔ̌, é sixú gbɛ́ ǎ, ɖó akpá e é kó dó n'i ɖo jǒnɔ lɛ́ɛ nukɔn é wú. "
"So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison, ","Azɔn ɖokpó ɔ́, axɔ́sú ɔ́ sɛ́ sɔ́ja tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó dó, bó ná ɛ gbe ɖɔ é ní yi gbo Jǎan sín ta wá. "
"and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. ","Sɔ́ja ɔ́ ká yi gankpá ɔ́ mɛ, bó gbo Jǎan sín ta dó gannúgbɛ́jɛ́ mɛ wá jó nú vǐ ɔ́, bɔ é sɔ́ yi jó nú nɔ tɔn. "
"On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb. ","Ée Jǎan sín ahwanvú lɛ́ɛ se mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě wá yi sɔ́ cyɔ tɔn bó yi ɖi. "
The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught. ,"Mɛsɛ́dó wěwe lɛ́ɛ lɛ́ kɔ wá Jezu gɔ́n, bó ɖó nǔ e yě wa lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpódó nǔ e yě kplɔ́n mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpó sín gbe n'i. "
"Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, “Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.” ","É ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi wá mǐ ní jɛ vo fí e mɛɖé ma ɖe ǎ é, bónú mi ná gbɔjɛ́ kpɛɖé.” Đó mɛ e wá ɖo yě ba kpɔ́n wɛ lɛ́ɛ sukpɔ́, bɔ mɛ ɖě ɖo wǐwá wɛ ɔ́, mɛ ɖě nɔ́ ɖo yiyi wɛ káká bɔ Jezu kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó sɔ́ mɔ tɛn ná ɖu nǔ vɔ́vɔ́ ǎ. "
So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place. ,"Bɔ yě byɔ́ tɔjíhún mɛ, bó ɖidó zɔ fí e mɛɖé ma ɖe ǎ é. "
But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. ,"Ée mɛ lɛ́ɛ mɔ yě xweyǐgbe ɔ́, mɛ gěgé wɔ́ fí e yě xwe ɔ́, bó nyi ahwan sín to lɛ́ɛ mɛ to lɛ́ɛ mɛ, bó zɔn afɔ, lobo kán wezun jɛ nukɔn nú yě yi fí ɔ́. "
"When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things. ","Ée Jezu wá jɛ te sín tɔjíhún ɔ́ mɛ wá agě jí ɔ́, é mɔ gbɛtɔ́ wɔ̌buwɔ́bú ɖé lɛ́ɛ, bɔ nǔ yětɔn blá wǔ n'i; ɖó yě cí lɛ̌ngbɔ́ e má ɖó lɛ̌ngbɔ́nyitɔ́ ǎ é ɖɔhun. Énɛ́ ɔ́, é jɛ nǔ gěgé kplɔ́n yě jí. "
"By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. “This is a remote place,” they said, “and it's already very late. ","Ée hwenu ko sɛ yi ɔ́, ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ sɛ yá ɛ, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Gblǒlǒ mɛ wɛ mǐ ɖe ɖo fí, hwenu ka ko sɛ yi tlala; "
Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.” ,"nyi mɛ lɛ́ɛ, nú yě yi gle lɛ́ɛ ta kpódó gletoxo e yá fí lɛ́ɛ kpó mɛ, lobo ba nǔɖé xɔ ɖu.” "
"But he answered, “You give them something to eat.” They said to him, “That would take eight months of a man's wages! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?” ","É ká yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi ɖésú mi ná nǔɖuɖu yě.” Lo ɔ́ yě yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Cóbónú è nǎ xɔ wɔ̌xúxú nú mɛ élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɔ́, è nǎ mɔ akwɛ́ ɖé bɔ é ná yi gankwɛ́ afɔɖé (200).” "
"“How many loaves do you have?” he asked. “Go and see.” When they found out, they said, “Five–and two fish.” ","Jezu ka kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Wɔ̌xúxú nabí ka ɖo mi sí? Mi yi kpɔ́n.” Ée yě kpɔ́n bó tunwun nabí e wɛ é ɔ́, yě wá ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Wɔ̌xúxú atɔ́ɔ́n kpódó hweví we kpó wɛ ɖo mǐ sí.” "
"Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. ","Énɛ́ gúdo tlóló ɔ́, Jezu ɖɔ nú ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ yě ní byɔ́ tɔjíhún ɔ́ mɛ jɛ nukɔn nú émí ɖidó Bɛtisayida ɖo agě ɖe ɔ́ jí dɔ̌n, bónú émí ɖésú ná nyi mɛ lɛ́ɛ sɛ́ dó xwé. "
"After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray. ","Ée é nyi mɛ lɛ́ɛ gúdo ɔ́, é xá só jí, bó xo ɖɛ. "
"When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land. ","Ée zǎn wá ɖo bibɔ wɛ ɔ́, tɔjíhún ɔ́ ko ɖo xuzan mɛ, bɔ Jezu ɖokpónɔ géé ka kpo ɖo agě ɔ́ jí. "
"He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them, ","Jezu mɔ ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ sɛ́ dó, bɔ yě ɖo kan ván wɛ ɖésú, dó ɖo hǔn ɔ́ kun wɛ, ɖó jɔhɔn kpé wɛ yě ɖe; bɔ, sín gan atɔn mɛ zǎn mɛ, sɔ́ yi ayǐtéhɔ̌nnu mɔ̌ ɔ́, é zun zɔnlin gbɔn xu ɔ́ jí yi yě gɔ̌n, bó jló ná zɛ yě wú.

"but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out, ","Ée ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ mɔ ɛ ɖo zɔnlin zun gbɔn xu ɔ́ jí wɛ ɔ́, yě vɛdó ɖɔ nǔ kpé wɛ émí ɖe sín, bó jɛ xó sú jí; "
"because they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke to them and said, “Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.” ","ɖó yě bǐ wɛ mɔ ɛ, bɔ ado hu yě. Lo ɔ́, é ɖɔ: “Mi kpan akɔ́n, nyɛ wɛ; mi ma ɖi xɛsi ó.” "
"Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed, ","É ka byɔ́ tɔjíhún e mɛ yě ɖe ɔ́ mɛ, bɔ jɔhɔn ɔ́ xwɛ, bɔ é kpácá yě ɖésú; "
for they had not understood about the loaves,Fon
"When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there. ","Jezu kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpán xo xu ɔ́ zlɛ́, bó wá glín hǔn dó Jenɛzalɛ́ti. "
"As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus. ","Ée yě jɛ te sín tɔjíhún ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, mɛ lɛ́ɛ mɔ Jezu bó tunwun i tlóló. "

"And wherever he went–into villages, towns or countryside–they placed the sick in the marketplaces.

"When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash.

And he said to them: “You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions! ,"Jezu lɛ́ ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi nɔ jó Mawusɛ́n lɛ́ɛ dó, bó nɔ́ xwedó hwɛndo mitɔn lɛ́ɛ, bɔ é nyí nǔ ɖagbe wa wɛ mi ɖe nɛ́. "
"For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’ ","Đó Mɔyízi ɖɔ: ‘Sí tɔ́ towe kpódó nɔ towe kpó; mɛ e ka ná dó nu tɔ́ tɔn abǐ nɔ tɔn ɔ́, è nǐ hu i.’ "

"Nothing outside a man can make him ‘unclean’ by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him ‘unclean.’ ” ","Nǔ e è nɔ ɖu dó xomɛ ɔ́ wɛ nɔ́ hɛn gbɛtɔ́ blí ǎ; lo ɔ́, nǔ e tɔ́n sín gbɛtɔ́ sín ayi mɛ ɔ́ wɛ nɔ́ hɛn ɛ blí. [ "

"For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body.” (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods “clean.”) ","Đó nǔ énɛ́ ɔ́, ayi mɛ wɛ é nɔ́ byɔ́ ǎ, adɔgo mɛ wɛ é nɔ́ byɔ́, bó nɔ́ wá yi tɔ́n hwenu è nɔ wá yi afɔ jí é.” (Gbɔn xó énɛ́ gbla mɛ ɔ́, Jezu lɛ́ ɖo ɖiɖe xlɛ́ wɛ ɖɔ nǔɖuɖu bǐ wɛ nyɔ́ bɔ è nǎ ɖu.)

"People were overwhelmed with amazement. “He has done everything well,” they said. “He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.”During those days another large crowd gathered. Since they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said, ","É kpácá mɛ lɛ́ɛ tlala, bɔ yě nɔ ɖɔ: “É nɔ́ bló nǔ bǐ ɖó.

"As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. ","Ée yě wá ɖo te jɛ sín só ɔ́ jí wɛ ɔ́, Jezu dó sɛ́n nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi ma ɖɔ nǔ e mi mɔ ɔ́ nú mɛɖé cóbónú Mawu ná fɔ́n nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ sín kú ó.” "

"When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them. ","Ée yě sɛkpɔ́ ahwanvú ɖě lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, yě mɔ ahwan gěgé lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó yě, bɔ sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖo nǔ dɔn xá yě wɛ. "

“What are you arguing with them about?” he asked. ,Jezu ka kanbyɔ́ ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Étɛ́ dɔn xá yě wɛ mi ka ɖe?” 
"A man in the crowd answered, “Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech. ","Mɛ ɖokpó ká ɖo ahwan ɔ́ mɛ, bó ɖɔ nú Jezu ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌si, un kplá vǐ ce wá nú we, nú a nǎ gbɔ azɔn n'i; ɖó yɛ e ɖo jǐ tɔn ɔ́ zɔ́n bɔ é nɔ́ sixú ɖɔ xó ǎ. "
"Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could not.” ","Nǔ ɔ́ wá n'i lě ɔ́, yɛ ɔ́ nɔ́ sɔ́ ɛ hu dó ayǐ, bɔ é nɔ́ jɛ afúntúnkplɔ̌ tún jí, bó nɔ́ jɛ aɖǔkún ɖu jí, lobo nɔ syɛ́n bǐ.

"“O unbelieving generation,” Jesus replied, “how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you?

"So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth. ","Bɔ yě kplá ɛ wá n'i.

"When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the evil spirit. “You deaf and mute spirit,” he said, “I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.” ","Jezu mɔ mɛ lɛ́ɛ nyi ahwan jǎwe, bó jɛ adǎn wa dó yɛ nyanya ɔ́ jí ɖɔ: “Yɛ nyanya tóhunúmɛtɔ́, ɖɛ̌hunúmɛtɔ́, un ɖe gbe dó we, gosín vǐ élɔ́ jí, bó má sɔ́ wá jǐ tɔn ɖě gbeɖé ó.” "
"The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, “He's dead.” ","Bɔ yɛ nyanya ɔ́ sú xó, bó húnhún vǐ ɔ́ kpódó zǐngídi kpó, bó gosín jǐ tɔn; bɔ vǐ ɔ́ jɛ ayǐ, bó cí mɛkúkú ɖɔhun, lobɔ mɛ gěgé vɛdó ɖɔ kú wɛ é kú sín. "
"But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up. ","Lo ɔ́, Jezu hɛn alɔ tɔn, bó zé e sí te, bɔ é nɔ te. "
"After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn't we drive it out?” ","Ée Jezu kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó wá yi xwé gbe ɔ́, yě kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Étɛ́wú mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ má ká kpé yɛ nyanya énɛ́ wú bó nya ǎ?” "

"Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (that is, the Son of Timaeus), was sitting by the roadside begging.

"“Go,” said Jesus, “your faith has healed you.” Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples, ","Jezu ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Yi, nǔ e a ɖi ɔ́ zɔ́n bɔ Mawu gbɔ azɔn nú we.” Azɔn ɖokpó ɔ́, nukún tɔn lɛ́ɛ hun, bɔ é wlí ali jɛ Jezu gúdo.Jezu kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó ko sɛkpɔ́ Jeluzalɛ́mu, bó ko ɖo malín málín mɛ dó Betaníi kpódó Bɛtifajée kpó, ɖo olívutín só ɔ́ kpá; bɔ Jezu sɛ́ ahwanvú tɔn we dó, "

"They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go. ","Yě ka yí gbe nú yě lě e Jezu ɖɔ gbɔn é, bɔ yě jó yě dó. "
"When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it. ","Yě kplá tócíví ɔ́ wá nú Jezu, bó tɛ́ awu yětɔn lɛ́ɛ nyi tócíví ɔ́ jí, bɔ Jezu jínjɔ́n jí. "

"Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs.

"John's baptism–was it from heaven, or from men? Tell me!” ","Mɛ̌ ká sɛ́ Jǎan dó bɔ é wá lɛ yɛhwesin nú mɛ? Mawu wɛ a, abǐ gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ? Mi ɖɔ nú má se.” "
"They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn't you believe him?’ ","Yě ka jɛ ɖiɖɔ jí ɖo yěɖée tɛ́ntin ɖɔ: “Ényí mǐ yí gbe n'i ɖɔ Mawu wɛ ɔ́, é ná kanbyɔ́ mǐ ɖɔ: ‘Bɔ étɛ́wú mi ma ka ɖi nǔ nú Jǎan ǎ?’ ” "

"So they answered Jesus, “We don't know.” Jesus said, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”He then began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey.

“What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others. ,"Jezu ka kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Nɛ̌ wɛ nya ɔ́ ka ná wa nǔ gbɔn? É ná wá, bó ná hu vǐwunzɔ́watɔ́ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ, lobo ná sɔ́ vǐwungbo ɔ́ dó alɔ mɛ nú mɛ ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ. "
Haven't you read this scripture: “ ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone,Fon
"the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?” ","Aklúnɔ sín nǔwiwa nɛ́, nǔjíwǔ wɛ é nyí ɖo nukún mǐtɔn mɛ.’ ” "
Then they looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd,Fon
Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words. ,"È sɛ́ Falizyɛn ɖé lɛ́ɛ kpódó Elódu sín ahwanvú ɖé lɛ́ɛ kpó dó Jezu gɔ́n, nú yě ná kan nǔ byɔ́ ɛ dó ɖó mɔ n'i, bó ná sixú wlí i ɖo xóɖiɖɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ. "
"They came to him and said, “Teacher, we know you are a man of integrity. You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?

Should we pay or shouldn't we?” But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. “Why are you trying to trap me?” he asked. “Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.” ,"Jezu ka tunwun ɖɔ ayi we zán xá émí wɛ yě ɖe, bó yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Étɛ́ sín mɔ ɖó nú mì wɛ mi ka ɖe?

"Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. ",Sinsɛngbɛ́ e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Saduseɛn lɛ́ɛ wá Jezu gɔ́n
"“Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother. ","“Mɛ̌si, nǔ e Mɔyízi wlán ɖ'ayǐ nú mǐ ɔ́ ɖíe: ‘Ényí mɛɖé ɖó nɔví súnnu, bó ka da asi, bó má ji vǐ ǎ, lobo kú jó asi tɔn dó ɔ́, nɔví tɔn ná sɔ́ asi ɔ́ da, bó ji vǐ ɖo xo tɔn mɛ, bó ná sixú ɖó donu nú nɔví tɔn e kú é.’ "
Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children. ,"Nɔví nɔví súnnu tɛ́nwe ɖé lɛ́ɛ ka tíin. Mɛ nukɔntɔn ɔ́ da asi, é ka ji vǐ ɖě ǎ, lobo kú jó asi ɔ́ dó. "
"The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the same with the third. ","Mɛ wegɔ́ ɔ́ sɔ́ asúkúsi ɔ́ da; é ka ji vǐ ǎ, bo kú. Mɔ̌ jɛ́n wɛ mɛ atɔngɔ́ ɔ́ lɔmɔ̌ tɔn nyí gbɔn é nɛ́. "
"In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too. ","Bɔ nɔví nɔví tɛ́nwe énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ kú ma ɖó vǐ donu. Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ lɔmɔ̌ wá kú. "
"At the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?” ","Hwenu e mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ ka na fɔ́n ɔ́, mɛ̌ sín asi wɛ nyɔ̌nu énɛ́ ɔ́ ka na wá nyí ɖo yě mɛ? Éɖíe ko nyí yě mɛ tɛ́nwe lɛ́ɛ bǐ sín asi kpɔ́n e.” "
"Jesus replied, “Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God? ","Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Hǔn mi mɔ ɖɔ ali bú wɛ émí ɖe din ǎ cé? Đó mi mɔ nukúnnú jɛ Mawuxó ɔ́ wú ǎ, mi ka lɛ́ mɔ nukúnnú jɛ hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n Mawu tɔn wú ǎ. "
"When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven. ","Hwenu e mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ bǐ ná wá fɔ́n sín kú ɔ́, mɛɖé ná da asi ǎ, mɛɖé ka ná da asú ǎ. Mɛ bǐ ná cí wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn e ɖo sɛ́xwé lɛ́ɛ ɖɔhun. "
"Now about the dead rising–have you not read in the book of Moses, in the account of the bush, how God said to him, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?

"He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!” ","Mawu nyí Mawu mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ tɔn ǎ; lo ɔ́, mɛ e ɖo gbɛ lɛ́ɛ sín Mawu wɛ é nyí. Ali bú wɛ mi ɖe ɖaxó.” "
"One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating.

The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no commandment greater than these.” ,Sɛ́n wegɔ́ ɔ́ ká ɖíe: ‘A nǎ yí wǎn nú nɔzo towe hwi ɖésúnɔ ɖɔhun.’ Sɛ́n ɖé sɔ́ hú gǎn énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ǎ.”

"To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.” ","Hǔn, gbɛtɔ́ ɖó ná yí wǎn nú Mawu kpódó ayixa tɔn bǐ kpó, kpódó linlin tɔn bǐ kpó, kpódó hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n tɔn bǐ kpó, bó ná yí wǎn nú nɔzo tɔn é ɖésúnɔ ɖɔhun; énɛ́ ɔ́ nyɔ́ hú vɔ̌ e è dó zo é, kpódó vɔ̌sísá ɖě lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpán.” "
"When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions.

"While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, “How is it that the teachers of the law say that the Christ is the son of David? ","Jezu kpo ɖo nǔ kplɔ́n mɛ wɛ ɖo sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́ mɛ, bó kanbyɔ́ ɖɔ: “Nɛ̌ wɛ sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ka sixú ɖɔ Klísu ɔ́ Davídi ví wɛ é nyí gbɔn? "
"David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: “ ‘The Lord said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.” ’ ","Đó Yɛsinsɛn sɔ́ dó ayi mɛ nú Davídi, bɔ é ɖésúnɔ ɖɔ: ‘Aklúnɔ ɖɔ nú Aklúnɔ ce ɖɔ: Jǐnjɔ́n ɖisí ce xwé, káká nú má sɔ́ kɛntɔ́ towe lɛ́ɛ dó bló afɔɖótɛn towe.’ "
David himself calls him ‘Lord.’ How then can he be his son?” The large crowd listened to him with delight. ,Davídi ɖésú nɛ́ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ ‘Aklúnɔ’ nɛ́. Nɛ̌ wɛ é ká sixú lɛ́ nyí vǐ tɔn gbɔn?” Xó énɛ́ e ɖɔ wɛ Jezu ɖe ɔ́ nyɔ́ se nú mɛ e ɖo fínɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ.

Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts. ,"Jezu jínjɔ́n ayǐ, bó kpan nukɔn gbǎ e mɛ è nɔ sɔ́ akwɛ́ dó ɔ́, bó ɖo lě e mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖo akwɛ́ sɔ́ dó gbǎ ɔ́ mɛ gbɔn wɛ ɔ́ kpɔ́n wɛ.

"They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything–all she had to live on.”As he was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Look, Teacher!

“Do you see all these great buildings?” replied Jesus. “Not one stone here will be left on another,Fon
"As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him privately, ","Jezu ka wá yi jínjɔ́n olívutín só ɔ́ jí, ɖo sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́ nukɔn. Piyɛ́ɛ kpódó Jaki kpó, kpódó Jǎan kpó, kpódó Andlé kpán ká wá yi mɔ ɛ, ɖo vo, bó kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: "

"While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take it; this is my body.” ","Hwenu e yě ɖo nǔ ɖu wɛ ɔ́, Jezu sɔ́ wɔ̌xúxú bó dó kú nú Mawu, bó kán, bó ná ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ bó ɖɔ: “Mi yí, élɔ́ ɔ́ agbaza ce wɛ.” "

"When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. ","Bɔ yě ji xwe ɔ́ sín han lɛ́ɛ, bó ɖidó olívutín só ɔ́ jí. "
"“You will all fall away,” Jesus told them, “for it is written: “ ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’ ","Jezu ɖɔ nú ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Mi bǐ wɛ nǔ e ɖo nǎ jɛ dó jǐ ce wɛ ɔ́ ná hɛn hǔn ná, bɔ mi bǐ ná gbadó; ɖó è wlǎn dó Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ɖɔ jí: ‘Un ná hu lɛ̌ngbɔ́nyitɔ́ ɔ́, bɔ lɛ̌ngbɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ná gbadó.’ "
"But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.” ","Lo ɔ́, hwenu e Mawu ná fɔ́n mì sín kú é gúdo ɔ́, un ná jɛ nukɔn nú mi yi Galilée.” "
"Peter declared, “Even if all fall away, I will not.” ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ bǐ na bó jó we dó ɔ́, nyɛ ɖo nǎ jó we dó wɛ ǎ.” "
"“I tell you the truth,” Jesus answered, “today–yes, tonight–before the rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times.” ","Bɔ Jezu ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Má ɖɔ nǔgbó nú we: hwɛ ɔ́, ɖo zǎn élɔ́ mɛ din ɔ́, cóbónú kokló ná kɔ́ así azɔn we ɔ́, a nǎ kó gbɛ́ azɔn atɔn ɖɔ émí kún tunwun mì ó.” "
"But Peter insisted emphatically, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.” And all the others said the same. ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka lɛ́ tɛ ɖɛ̌ jí syɛ́nsyɛ́n, bó ɖɔ: “É ná bó byɔ́ ɖɔ un ná yi kú xá we ɔ́, un ná gbɛ́ ɖɔ un kún tunwun we ó gbeɖé ǎ.” Bɔ ahwanvú ɖě lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌ ɖɔ nǔ ɖokpó ɔ́. "
"They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, “Sit here while I pray.” ","Jezu kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó wá yi tɛn e mɛ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Jɛtisemaníi é. É ɖɔ nú ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Mi jínjɔ́n fí, bónú má yi xo ɖɛ bó wá.” "
"He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled. ","É ka kplá Piyɛ́ɛ kpódó Jaki kpó, kpódó Jǎan kpán. Xɛsi ɖaxó ɖé jɛ jǐ tɔn, bɔ ado jɛ huhu i jí. "
"“My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death,” he said to them. “Stay here and keep watch.” ","Đó é ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Aluwɛ e nɔ dɔn mɛ yi kú é mɛ wɛ un ɖe; mi nɔ fí, bó nɔ wunzɛn.” "
"Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him. ","Ée é ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, é sɛ yi nukɔn kpɛví ɖé, bó xwe agbɔ̌nnusú do, bó jɛ ɖɛ xo jí ɖɔ nǔ sixú nyí mɔ̌ hǔn, wǔvɛ́ sín hwenu élɔ́ ɔ́ ní dín wá yi dó émí. "

"Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. “Simon,” he said to Peter, “are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?

"Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.” ","Mi nɔ wunzɛn bó xo ɖɛ, bó má wá jɛ tɛ́nkpɔ́n mɛ ó, ɖó gbɛtɔ́ ɖó jlǒ ɖagbe, lo ɔ́, agbaza tɔn ɖó gǎn ɖé ǎ.” "
Once more he went away and prayed the same thing. ,"É lɛ́ sɛ yi zɔ, bó vɔ́ ɖɛ ɖokpó ɔ́ xo. "
"When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him. ","É lɛ́ lɛ́ kɔ wá, bó lɛ́ mɔ yě ɖo amlɔ dɔ́ wɛ, ɖó nukún yětɔn bǐ wɛ kpɛn, bɔ yě sɔ́ tunwun nǔ e yě ná ɖɔ n'i ɔ́ ǎ. "
"Returning the third time, he said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. ","Ée é lɛ́ kɔ wá azɔn atɔngɔ́ ɔ́, é ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi lɛ́ kpo ɖo amlɔ dɔ́ wɛ, bó ɖo gbigbɔ́jɛ́ wɛ a? É kpé lo; gan ɔ́ kó xo. Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ ɖíe è jǒ nyi hwɛhutɔ́ lɛ́ɛ lɔ mɛ e. "
Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!” ,Mi bo sí te nú mǐ ná yi. Mi kpɔ́n! Mɛ e ɖo sísɔ́ mì jó wɛ ɔ́ ɖíe kó sɛ yá e.” 
"Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders. ","Jezu kpo ɖo xó ɖɔ wɛ, bɔ mɛ e nyí Judási ɖo ahwanvú tɔn wěwe lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɔ́ wá tlóló, bɔ mɛ gěgé ɖé lɛ́ɛ xwedó e, bó hɛn hwǐ kpódó kpo kpán.

Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The one I kiss is the man,Fon
"Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, “Rabbi!” and kissed him. ","Ée Judási wá tlóló ɔ́, é sɛkpɔ́ Jezu, bó ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌si”, lobo kí si n'i. "
The men seized Jesus and arrested him. ,Bɔ yě wlí i. 
"Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. ","Mɛ e ɖo kpɔ́ xá Jezu lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó sún hwǐ, bó xú vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó ɔ́ sín mɛsɛntɔ́, bó kpa tó e. "
"“Am I leading a rebellion,” said Jesus, “that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? ","Jezu ka yí xó, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Ajotɔ́ axánsúnxó wɛ un ka nyí bɔ mi hɛn hwǐ kpódó kpo kpó bó ja wlǐwlí mì gbé a? "
"Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.” ","Ayǐhɔ́ngbe ayǐhɔ́ngbe wɛ un nɔ ɖo mi tɛ́ntin, bó nɔ́ ɖo nǔ kplɔ́n mɛ wɛ ɖo sinsɛnxɔ mɛ, có mi ka wlí mì ǎ. Lo ɔ́, nǔ e è ko wlán dó Mawuxówéma mɛ ɔ́ ná dó jɛ wú wɛ.” "
Then everyone deserted him and fled. ,"Ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ bǐ jó e dó, bó hɔn. "
"A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him, ","Nyaví dɔ̌nkpɛvú ɖé ká xwedó Jezu, lobo ɖo avɔ ɖokpó géé mɛ, bɔ yě wlí i. "
"he fled naked, leaving his garment behind. ","Lo ɔ́, é jó avɔ tɔn dó, bó hɔn mɛ̌ jɔgbe. "
"They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders and teachers of the law came together. ","È kplá Jezu yi vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó Kayífu xwé, bɔ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ, mɛxó lɛ́ɛ, kpódó sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpó sín afɔ sɔgbe ɖo fínɛ́. "
"Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire. ","Piyɛ́ɛ jɛ Jezu gúdo; é ká lɔn bó sɛkpɔ́ ɛ ǎ; é nɔ zɔ n'i káká yi vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó ɔ́ sín xwé gbe. É yi jínjɔ́n mɛsɛntɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpá, bó ɖo myɔ xú wɛ. "
"The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any. ","Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó toxóɖɔgbɛ́ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn kpó ɖo hwɛ e yě ná dó Jezu, bó ná hu i é ba wɛ. "
"Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree. ","Mɛ gěgé wá ɖe kúnnu agɔ n'i; lo ɔ́, kúnnu e yě ɖe lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, ɖě sɔgbe xá ɖě ǎ. "
Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him: ,"Mɛ ɖé lɛ́ɛ ká sí te, bó ɖe kúnnu agɔ élɔ́ n'i, bó ɖɔ: "
"“We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this man-made temple and in three days will build another, not made by man.’ ” ","“Mǐ se, bɔ é ɖɔ: ‘Un ná gba sinsɛnxɔ élɔ́ e gbɛtɔ́ sɔ́ alɔ dó gbá é, bó ná sɔ́ azǎn atɔn ɖó te, bó ná gbá ɖěvo e gbɛtɔ́ sín alɔ ma gbá ǎ é.’ ” "
Yet even then their testimony did not agree. ,"Lo ɔ́, akpá énɛ́ xwé ɖésú ɔ́, kúnnu e yě ɖe lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌ nyí ɖokpó ɔ́ ǎ. "
"Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, “Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?” ","Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó ɔ́ ká sí te ɖo agun ɔ́ tɛ́ntin, bó kanbyɔ́ Jezu ɖɔ: “Nǔ e kúnnuɖetɔ́ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ dó wǔ towe ɔ́ nɛ́, a ɖǒ nu ɖé ná kɛ d'é wú a?” "
"But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?” ","Jezu ka tin, bó gɔn gbe yí, bɔ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó ɔ́ lɛ́ vɔ́ kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Hwi wɛ nyí Klísu, vǐ Mawu e mɛ bǐ nɔ́ xomlá ɔ́ tɔn a?” "
"“I am,” said Jesus. “And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.” ","Bɔ Jezu yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Nyɛ wɛ, bɔ mi ná wá mɔ nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n ɖo Mawu Nǔbǐwúkpétɔ́ ɔ́ sín ɖisíxwé; mi ná lɛ́ mɔ mì, bɔ un ná gosín jǐnukúnsin jǎwe ɖo akpɔ́kpɔ́ mɛ.” "
The high priest tore his clothes. “Why do we need any more witnesses?” he asked. ,"Ée vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó ɔ́ se xó énɛ́ e Jezu ɖɔ ɔ́, é vún awu dó kɔ nú éɖée, bó ɖɔ: “Kúnnuɖiɖe tɛ́ ba wɛ mi ka sɔ́ kpo ɖe? "
“You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?” They all condemned him as worthy of death. ,"Mi ma se nu e é nylá dó Mawu wú ɔ́ a? Étɛ́ mi lin d'é wú?” Bɔ yě bǐ gblé hwɛ dó ta nú Jezu, bó ɖɔ kú wɛ jɛ xá ɛ. "
"Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, “Prophesy!” And the guards took him and beat him. ","Mɛ ɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖo yě mɛ, bó jɛ atán tún kɔn nyi wú tɔn jí; yě blǎ nukún mɛ n'i, bo jɛ nǔ dó e jí, bo nɔ ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Đɔ mɛ e dó nǔ we ɔ́.” Bɔ sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ dɔn ɛ, bo jɛ tó mɛ xo n'i jí. "
"While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by. ","Piyɛ́ɛ kpo ɖo fí e é ɖo myɔ xú ɖe wɛ é, bɔ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó ɔ́ sín mɛsɛntɔ́ nyɔ̌nu ɖokpó wá mɔ ɛ. "
"When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. “You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus,” she said. ","Ée é mɔ ɛ ɖo myɔ xú wɛ ɔ́, é kpɔ́n ɛ tlítlí, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Hwi lɔmɔ̌ a nɔ xwedó Jezu Nazalɛ́ti tɔn ɔ́.” "
"But he denied it. “I don't know or understand what you're talking about,” he said, and went out into the entryway. ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka gbɛ́, bo ɖɔ: “Un tunwun i ǎ, un ka mɔ nukúnnú jɛ nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ a ɖe nɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ lɔ ǎ;” ée é ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, é ɖidó hɔntogbó jí, bɔ kokló kɔ́ así. "
"When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, “This fellow is one of them.” ","Nyɔ̌nu mɛsɛntɔ́ ɔ́ ka lɛ́ wá mɔ ɛ ɖo hɔntogbó ɔ́ jí, bo lɛ́ jɛ ɖiɖɔ nú mɛ e ɖo fínɛ́ lɛ́ɛ jí ɖɔ: “Mɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó nɛ́.” "
"Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, “Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.” ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka lɛ́ gbɛ́. É nɔ zaan, bɔ mɛ e ɖo fínɛ́ lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌ ɖɔ nú Piyɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “A ɖo mɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ dandan; ɖó Galiléenu wɛ a nyǐ.” "
"He began to call down curses on himself, and he swore to them, “I don't know this man you're talking about.” ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka jɛ ɖiɖɔ jí ɖɔ: “Ényí nǔvú ɖó wɛ un ɖe hǔn, Mawu ní dɔn tó nú mì. Un xwlé Mawu ɖɔ un kún tunwun nya e xó ɖɔ wɛ mi ɖe nɛ́ ɔ́ ó.” "
"Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times.” And he broke down and wept.Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision. They bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate. ","Tɛn tɔn mɛ tlóló ɔ́, kokló kɔ́ así azɔn wegɔ́ ɔ́, bɔ Piyɛ́ɛ flín xó e Jezu ko ɖɔ n'i ɖ'ayǐ é: “Cóbónú kokló ná kɔ́ así azɔn wegɔ́ ɔ́, a nǎ kó gbɛ́ azɔn atɔn ɖɔ émí kún tunwun mì ó,” lobo lin tamɛ dó xó nɛ́ ɔ́ wú, bó wlí avǐ.É wá su zǎnzǎn tɛɛn, bɔ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ, mɛxó lɛ́ɛ, kpódó sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpó, kpódó toxóɖɔgbɛ́ ɔ́ kpó kplé, bó yi kpá dó Jezu wú.

"“Are you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate. “Yes, it is as you say,” Jesus replied. ",Pilátu ka kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Hwi wɛ nyí Jwifu lɛ́ɛ sín axɔ́sú ɔ́ a?” Jezu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Hwi wɛ ɖɔ.” 
The chief priests accused him of many things. ,Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ ka ɖo hwɛ tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ dó e wɛ. 
"So again Pilate asked him, “Aren't you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of.” ",Pilátu ka lɛ́ kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “A sɔ́ ɖó nu ɖé ná kɛ ǎ cé? Kpɔ́n nǔ tobutóbú e sín hwɛ dó we wɛ yě ɖe é.” 
"But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed. ","Lo ɔ́, Jezu sɔ́ kɛ nu ǎ, bɔ é kpácá Pilátu. "
Now it was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested. ,"È ko ja Dǐndínwáyi sín xwe ɖu gbé tɛgbɛ ɔ́, Pilátu nɔ ɖe gantɔ́ ɖěe yě kó sixú byɔ́ ɛ ɔ́ ɖokpó nyi te nú yě. "
A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising. ,"Nya ɖé ka tíin, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Balabási. È wlǐ nya énɛ́ dó gankpá mɛ, é kpódó todántɔ́ ɖé lɛ́ɛ kpó, ɖó yě dɔn hunnyahunnya dó to mɛ, bó hu mɛ ɖokpó. "
The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did. ,"Agun ɔ́ sɛ yi Pilátu gɔ́n, bo byɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ ní ɖe gantɔ́ ɖokpó nyi te nú émí lě e è ko nɔ bló gbɔn xwewú xwewú tɛgbɛ é. "
"“Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate, ",Bɔ Pilátu yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi jló nú má ɖe Jwifu lɛ́ɛ xɔ́sú ɔ́ nyi te nú mi a?” 
knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him. ,Đó é mɔ nǔ jɛ wú ɖɔ mɛnúvɛ́mɛwú wɛ zɔ́n bɔ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ wlí Jezu wá jó nú émí. 
But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead. ,Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ ka fɔ́n hun dó jǐ nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ nú yě ní byɔ́ ɖɔ é ní gbɔ bó ɖe Balabási nyi te nú émí. 
"“What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?” Pilate asked them. ","Pilátu ka yí xó, bó kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Nɛ̌ wɛ un ka ná wa mɛ e mi nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ xɔ́sú ɔ́ sín nǔ gbɔn?” "
“Crucify him!” they shouted. ,"Bɔ yě bǐ sú xó, bo ɖɔ: “Ká ɛ nyi aklúzu jí.” "
"“Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!” ","Pilátu lɛ́ vɔ́ kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Nǔ nyanya tɛ́ é ka wa?” Bɔ agun ɔ́ lɛ́ sú xó syɛ́nsyɛ́n, bó ɖɔ: “Ká ɛ nyi aklúzu jí.” "
"Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified. ","Pilátu ka jló ná nyɔ́ ɖo yě sí, bo ɖe Balabási nyi te nú yě; é ka zɔ́n bɔ è xo Jezu, bɔ é jó e nú yě, nú yě na ká ɛ nyi aklúzu jí. "
"The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers. ","Sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ kplá Jezu yi hɔnmɛ, lobo ylɔ́ ahwankpá ɔ́ bǐ kplé. "
"They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him. ","Yě sɔ́ awu gaga vɔ́vɔ́ ɖé dó n'i, lobo sɔ́ wun dó lɔn axɔ́súgbákún ɖokpó, bó zé xwe n'i. "
"And they began to call out to him, “Hail, king of the Jews!” ","Bó jɛ gbe dó e jí ɖɔ: “Mǐ kan xwé byɔ́, Jwifu lɛ́ɛ xɔ́sú!” "
"Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him. ","Yě nɔ dó fántín ta n'i, bó nɔ́ tún atán kɔn nyi wútu tɔn, bó nɔ́ jɛ kpo nukɔn tɔn, bó nɔ́ ɖe kɔ́ n'i. "
"And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him. ","Ée yě cá ɛ ko mɔ̌ káká ɔ́, yě wǎ ɖe awu vɔ́vɔ́ ɔ́ sín kɔ n'i, lobo fɔ awu é ɖésúnɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ dó n'i, bó kplá ɛ tɔ́n sín xwé ɔ́ gbe, bó ná yi ká ɛ nyi aklúzu jí. "
"A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross. ","Sinmɔ́ɔ Silenɛ́ɛnu ɔ́ gosín gleta wá xweyǐgbe. Alɛsándlu kpódó Hlufúsi kpó sín tɔ́ wɛ. Sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ zɔ́n ɛ gǎnnugǎnnu, ɖɔ é ní ɖíɖá aklúzu Jezu tɔn. "
They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull). ,Yě kplá Jezu yi tɛn e mɛ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Gɔlugɔta dó Ebléegbe mɛ é. Gɔlugɔta ɔ́ sín tínmɛ wɛ nyí “takágo tɛnmɛ”. 
"Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. ",Yě ná ɛ vɛ̌ɛn e è cáká kpódó mǐla kpó é
"And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get. ","Bɔ yě ká ɛ nyi aklúzu jí, bó nyi akɔ dó awu tɔn lɛ́ɛ, bó má yětɔn yětɔn. "
It was the third hour when they crucified him. ,Zǎnzǎn gan tɛ́nnɛ mɛ mɔ̌ wɛ yě ká ɛ nyi aklúzu jí. 
The written notice of the charge against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS. ,Yě wlán nǔ e wú yě ɖó kúhwɛ n'i ɔ́ ɖó ta tɔn nu ɖo aklúzu ɔ́ jí ɖɔ: “Axɔ́sú Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn.” 
"They crucified two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left. ","Yě ká ajotɔ́ axánsúnxó we nyi aklúzu jí gɔ́ n'i: mɛ ɖokpó ɖo ɖisí tɔn xwé, mɛ ɖokpó ɖo amyɔ tɔn xwé. [ "
"Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, “So!

come down from the cross and save yourself!” ,"Hwlɛ̌n hwiɖée gán, bó jɛ te sín aklúzu ɔ́ jí.” "
"In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. “He saved others,” they said, “but he can't save himself!

"Let this Christ, this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.” Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.

At the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour. ,"Ée gan wěwe xo ɔ́, ablu dó ɖo ayǐkúngban jí káká yi jɛ gan atɔn mɛ. "
"And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” –which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” ","Ée gan atɔn xo ɔ́, Jezu sú xó tlílí, bó ɖɔ: “Elíi Elíi, lama sabakitani?” (Tínmɛ tɔn wɛ nyí: “Mawu ce, Mawu ce, nɛ̌ ká gbɔn bɔ a jǒ mì dó?”) "
"When some of those standing near heard this, they said, “Listen, he's calling Elijah.” ","Mɛ e ɖo fínɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖě se xó e Jezu ɖɔ nɛ́ ɔ́, bó ɖɔ: “Mi kpɔ́n! É ɖo Elíi ylɔ́ wɛ.” "
"One man ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. “Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down,” he said.

"With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last. ","Jezu ka sú xó ɖaxó ɖé, bó bɔnu. "
The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. ,Avɔ ɖaxó e è dó gbo sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́ mɛ ná ɔ́ dá ɖó we sín jǐ káká wá do. 
"And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and saw how he died, he said, “Surely this man was the Son of God!” ","Ée sɔ́ja kanwekogán Hlɔ̌manu e ɖo te ɖo Jezu nukɔn ɔ́ mɔ lě e é kú gbɔn ɔ́, é ɖɔ: “Nya élɔ́ ɔ́, Mawu ví wɛ é nyí nǔgbó.” "
"Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.

In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs.

"It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached, ","Ée zǎn jɛ bibɔ jí, bɔ gbe énɛ́ gbe ká lɛ́ nyí gbɔjɛzán Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn kpo sɔ ɔ́, "
"Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.

"Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died. ","Lě e Jezu yá wǔ kú gbɔn ɔ́ kpácá Pilátu, bɔ é ylɔ́ sɔ́ja kanwekogán ɔ́, bó kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “É kú ɔ́, é kó lín wɛ a?” "
"When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph. ","Bɔ sɔ́ja kanwekogán ɔ́ yí gbe n'i ɖɔ é kó kú xóxó, bɔ é ná gbe Jozɛ́fu ɖɔ ní bó yi zé cyɔ ɔ́. "
"So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.

"Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus' body.

"Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb ","Aklúnɔzán gbe zǎnzǎn tɛɛn hwenu e hwe ɖo tíntɔ́n wɛ ɔ́, yě yi Jezu sín yɔdo kɔn. "

"As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed. ","Yě byɔ́ yɔdo ɔ́ mɛ, bó mɔ dɔ̌nkpɛvú ɖé ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n ɖo ɖisíxwé, bɔ é dó awu wěwé, bɔ xɛsi ɖaxó ɖé jɛ yě jǐ. "
"“Don't be alarmed,” he said. “You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him.

"Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid. ","Ayi yětɔn bǐ gbadó, bɔ yě ɖo sísɔ́sísɔ́ wɛ, bó tɔ́n sín yɔdo ɔ́ mɛ, bó hɔn. Yě ká glá ɖɔ xó ɖé nú mɛɖé ǎ, ɖó yě ɖo xɛsi ɖi wɛ. [ "
"When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons. ","Ée è fɔ́n Jezu sín kú Aklúnɔzán gbe zǎnzǎn ɔ́, é tó sɔ́ éɖée xlɛ́ Mali Magidalanu e jí é nya yɛ nyanya tɛ́nwe sín é hwɛ̌. "

"When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it. ","Ée yě se ɖɔ Jezu ɖo gbɛ, bɔ Mali mɔ ɛ ɔ́, yě ɖi ǎ. "
Afterward Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, Jezu sín ahwanvú we ɖo ali jí xwe gleta. Jezu ka sɔ́ ninɔmɛ ɖěvo, bo tɔ́n dó yě jǐ. "
These returned and reported it to the rest,Fon
Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating,Fon
"He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation. ","É ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi gbɔn gbɛ ɔ́ bǐ mɛ, bo jlá Wɛn Ɖagbe Mawu tɔn ɔ́ gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ. "
"Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. ","Mɛ e ná ɖi nǔ, bɔ è nǎ lɛ yɛhwesin n'i ɔ́ ná gán. Mɛ e ma ka na ɖi nǔ ǎ ɔ́, è nǎ ɖǒ hwɛ n'i. "
And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons, 
"they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.” ","Yě na bo zé dan ɔ́, é ná wa nǔɖé nú yě ǎ; yě na bo nu nǔvɛ́nu ɔ́, é ná wa nǔɖé nú yě ǎ.

"After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God. ","Ée Aklúnɔ ɖɔ xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ nú yě gúdo ɔ́, è sɔ́ ɛ yi jǐnukúnsin, bɔ é jínjɔ́n ɖisíxwé nú Mawu. "
"Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it.Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, ","Ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ka sɔ́nǔ, bó jɛ Mawuxó jlá jí gbɔn fí bǐ.

so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. ,bónú a nǎ dó tunwun nǔgbó e ɖo nǔ e è kplɔ́n we lɛ́ɛ mɛ é. 
"In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron. ","Hwenu e Elódu ɖo axɔ́sú ɖu wɛ ɖo Jwifu lɛ́ɛ sín tomɛ ɔ́, vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖokpó ɖo fínɛ́, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Zakalíi, bɔ é ɖo vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ Abiya sín gbɛ̌ta mɛ.

"Both of them were upright in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commandments and regulations blamelessly. ","Yě mɛ we lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ nɔ wa jlǒ Mawu tɔn, bó nɔ́ nyi Aklúnɔ sɛ́n lɛ́ɛ, bɔ nǔ bǐ vɔ ɖ'é wú. "
"But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren; and they were both well along in years. ","Yě ká ji vǐ ǎ, ɖó wɛnsinɔ wɛ nú Elizabɛ́ti, bɔ yě mɛ we lɛ́ɛ bǐ sín xwe ka ko sɛ yi. "
"Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God, ","É wá su gbe ɖokpó, bɔ Zakalíi ɖo vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ sín azɔ̌ tɔn lɛ́ɛ wa wɛ ɖo Mawu nukɔn, ɖó gbɛ̌ta e mɛ é ɖe ɔ́ jí wɛ sinsɛnxɔmɛzɔ́ jɛ hwe énɛ́ nu. "
"he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. ","È ka wá nyi akɔ, bó zé Zakalíi lě e walɔ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ lɛ́ɛ tɔn zɔ́n gbɔn é, nú é ná byɔ́ tɛn mímɛ́ Aklúnɔ tɔn mɛ, bó ná dó zǎlínkpɔ́n zo, bó xwlé Mawu. "
"And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside. ","Togun ɔ́ bǐ kplé ɖo hɛnkɛ́n, bó ɖo ɖɛ xo wɛ hwenu e Zakalíi ɖo zǎlínkpɔ́n dó zo wɛ é. "
"Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. ","Wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn ɖokpó ká tɔ́n dó Zakalíi jí, bó ɖo te ɖo ɖisíxwé nú vɔ̌sákpe e jí è nɔ dó zǎlínkpɔ́n zo ɖe é. "
"When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear. ","Ée Zakalíi mɔ ɛ lě ɔ́, ayi tɔn bǐ gbadó, bɔ xɛsi jɛ jǐ tɔn. "
"But the angel said to him: “Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John. ","Wɛnsagun ɔ́ ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Zakalíi, ma ɖi xɛsi ó; ɖó Mawu yí gbe nú nǔ e a byɔ́ ɛ é. Asi towe Elizabɛ́ti ná ji vǐ súnnu ɖokpó nú we, bɔ a nǎ sun nyǐ i ɖɔ Jǎan. "
"He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth, ","É ná víví nú we, bɔ a nǎ j'awǎ tɔn, bɔ xomɛ ná hun mɛ gěgé ɖó jiji tɔn wú. "
"for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth.

Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God. ,É ná bló bɔ Izlayɛ́li ví gěgé ná lɛ́ kɔ wá Aklúnɔ Mawu yětɔn gɔ́n. 
"And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous–to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.” ","Mawu ná ná ɛ Yɛ e é ná Elíi é, bó ná lɛ́ ná ɛ hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n e é ná Elíi é, bɔ é ná wá jɛ nukɔn nú Aklúnɔ bó ná dó hwɛ gbɔ nú tɔ́ kpódó vǐ kpó.

"Zechariah asked the angel, “How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years.” ","Zakalíi ka kanbyɔ́ wɛnsagun ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Ani wɛ ná xlɛ́ mì ɖɔ nǔ mɔ̌hunkɔ ná jɛ? Nyɛ ɖíe kó kpo e, bɔ asi ce lɔ sín xwe ka ko sɛ yi.” "
"The angel answered, “I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news. ","Wɛnsagun ɔ́ yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Nyɛ wɛ nyí Gabliyɛ́li, bó nɔ́ nɔ te ɖo Mawu nukɔn. É wɛ sɛ́ mì dó, nú má ɖɔ xó nú we, lobo dó Wɛn Ɖagbe énɛ́ we. "
"And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their proper time.” ","Xó e un ɖɔ nú we ɔ́ ná jɛ ɖo hwe tɔn nu.

"Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple. ","Hwenu e nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖo jijɛ wɛ ɔ́, togun ɔ́ ka ɖo te kpɔ́n Zakalíi, bɔ lě e é lin sɔ ɖo sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́ nyí nǔ, bó hu ado nú yě. "
"When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.

After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. ,"Azǎn ɖé jɛ ǎ, bɔ asi tɔn Elizabɛ́ti mɔ xo; é sɔ́ nɔ́ tɔ́n sín xwé tɔn gbe ǎ káká xɔ sun atɔ́ɔ́n, bó nɔ́ ɖɔ jí: "

"In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, ","Ée Elizabɛ́ti sín adɔgo ɖó sun ayizɛ́n ɔ́, Mawu sɛ́ wɛnsagun Gabliyɛ́li dó Galilée sín toxo e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Nazalɛ́ti é mɛ, nú é ná yi dó wɛn ɖyɔ̌vǐ ɖé.

For nothing is impossible with God.” ,Đó nǔ ɖěbǔ gló Mawu ǎ.”

where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth. ,"É byɔ́ Zakalíi xwé gbe, bó dó gbe Elizabɛ́ti. "
"When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. ","Ée Elizabɛ́ti se gbedómɛ Mali tɔn lě ɔ́, vǐ e ɖo xo tɔn mɛ é dán wǔ, bɔ Yɛsinsɛn gɔ́ ayi mɛ nú Elizabɛ́ti, "

"As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. ","Ée un se gbedómɛ towe lě ɔ́, é víví nú vǐ e ɖo xo ce mɛ é, bɔ é dán wǔ. "
Blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished!” ,"Nǔ nyɔ́ nú we, ɖó a ɖi nǔ ɖɔ akpá e Aklúnɔ dó nú émí ɔ́ ná jɛ.” "
And Mary said: “My soul glorifies the Lord ,"Mali ɖɔ: “Un ɖo susu kpa nú Aklúnɔ ce wɛ, "

"When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.” ","Ée wɛnsagun lɛ́ɛ jó lɛ̌ngbɔ́nyitɔ́ lɛ́ɛ dó, bo lɛ́ kɔ ɖidó jǐxwé ɔ́, lɛ̌ngbɔ́nyitɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ nú yěɖée ɖɔ: “Mi nú mi na hun káká yi Bɛteleyɛ́mu, bó ná yi kpɔ́n nǔ e jɛ bɔ Aklúnɔ dó wɛn tɔn sɛ́ dó mǐ é.” "

"On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise him, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he had been conceived. ","Gbe e gbe vǐ ɔ́ ɖó azǎn tántɔn, bɔ è gbo ada n'i ɔ́, è sun nyǐ i ɖɔ “Jezu”; nyǐkɔ énɛ́ ɔ́ wɛ wɛnsagun ɔ́ ko ɖɔ nú Mali ɖ'ayǐ, cóbɔ é wá mɔ xo tɔn. "
"When the time of their purification according to the Law of Moses had been completed, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord ","Hwenu e è ɖǒ ná slá wǔ nú Jozɛ́fu kpódó Mali kpó lě e Mɔyízi sɛ́n ɔ́ zɔ́n gbɔn ɔ́ wá su, bɔ é kplá vǐ ɔ́ yi Jeluzalɛ́mu, bó ná sɔ́ ɛ xwlé Mawu.

"Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. ","Nya ɖé ka ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu hwenɛ́nu, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Simɛ́nyɔ́ɔ. Nya énɛ́ ɔ́ nɔ́ xwedó Mawusɛ́n lɛ́ɛ, bó nɔ́ jɛ hun dó Mawu sín azɔ̌ lɛ́ɛ jí.

It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ. ,Yɛsinsɛn ka ko ɖe xlɛ́ ɛ ɖɔ é kún ná kú ma mɔ Klísu Aklúnɔ tɔn ɖó nukún wú ó. 
"Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required, ","Yɛsinsɛn ka wá ɖɔ xó dó ayi mɛ n'i, bɔ é wá sinsɛnxɔ mɛ hwenu e Jezu sín mɛ lɛ́ɛ kplá Jezu wá, bó ja yɛsu e Mɔyízisɛ́n zɔ́n ɔ́ fɔ n'i gbé é. "
"Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying: ","Simɛ́nyɔ́ɔ ka yí vǐ ɔ́ dó awa mɛ, bó dó kú nú Mawu ɖɔ: "
"“Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you now dismiss your servant in peace. ","“Din ɔ́, Aklúnɔ, jǒ nyɛ mɛsɛntɔ́ towe dó, lě e a ko ɖɔ gbɔn é, nú ma yi ɖo fífá mɛ; "

The child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him. ,Nǔ e ɖɔ dó vǐ ɔ́ wú wɛ Simɛ́nyɔ́ɔ ɖe ɔ́ ká nɔ́ kpácá vǐtɔ́ ɔ́ kpódó vǐnɔ ɔ́ kpó. 
"Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: “This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against, ","Simɛ́nyɔ́ɔ xo ɖɛ dó yě jí, bó ká ɖɔ nú Mali vǐ ɔ́ sín nɔ ɖɔ: “Nywɛ̌ ɖɔ Mawu sɔ́ vǐ élɔ́, bɔ é ná nyí afɔklɛ́nnú nú Izlayɛ́li ví gěgé, bó ká ná lɛ́ sɔ́ yě mɛ gěgé sí te.

"There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, ","Nyɔ̌nu gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn ɖé ka ɖo fínɛ́, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Ana; Fanuwɛli ví wɛ, bɔ é jɔ ɖo akɔta Acɛ́ɛ tɔn mɛ; xwe tɔn ko sɛ yi tlala.

"and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying. ","É ka sɔ́ da asú ɖě ǎ, káká bó ɖó xwe kanwe-nukún-ɛnɛ (84); é nɔ́ cí sinsɛnxɔ mɛ, bɔ zǎn kpódó kéze kpó ɔ́, é nɔ́ ɖo Mawu sɛn wɛ, ɖo nubláblá kpó ɖɛxixo kpó mɛ. "
"Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem. ","Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, é wá yě gɔ̌n, bó jɛ Mawu kpa jí, bó jɛ vǐ ɔ́ xó ɖɔ nú mɛ e ɖo te kpɔ́n hwlɛngán Jeluzalɛ́mu tɔn lɛ́ɛ é bǐ jǐ. "
"When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth. ","Ée Mali kpódó Jozɛ́fu kpó bló nǔ e Aklúnɔ sɛ́n zɔ́n lɛ́ɛ bǐ fó ɔ́, yě kpó vǐ ɔ́ kpó lɛ́ kɔ wá yi to yětɔn Nazalɛ́ti ɔ́ mɛ, ɖo Galilée yíkúngban jí. "
"And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him. ","Vǐ ɔ́ ka ɖo susu wɛ, bɔ hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n ɖo wǔ tɔn wá wɛ; nǔnywɛ́ kpé e; bɔ nyɔ̌ná Mawu tɔn ɖo kpɔ́ xá ɛ. "
Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover. ,"Xwewú xwewú ɔ́, Jezu sín tɔ́ kpódó nɔ tɔn kpó nɔ́ yi ɖu Dǐndínwáyixwe ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu. "
"When he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom. ","Hwenu e Jezu ka wá ɖó xwe wěwe ɔ́, yě yi xwe ɔ́ ɖu gbé ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu lě e yě kó nɔ́ bló gbɔn é. "
"After the Feast was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. ","Ée yě ɖu xwe ɔ́ fó ɔ́, yě wlí xwé sín ali; lo ɔ́, Jezu cí Jeluzalɛ́mu, bɔ mɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ ká tunwun ǎ. "
"Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. ","Yě vɛdó ɖɔ é kpó émí kpó ɖo yiyi wɛ sín, bó ɖi zɔnlin kéze ɖokpó, cóbó wá jɛ biba ɛ jí gbɔn mɛ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ kpódó mɛtunwunmɛ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ kpán mɛ. "
"When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. ","Ée yě má mɔ ɛ ǎ ɔ́, yě lɛ́ kɔ wá Jeluzalɛ́mu, bó kpo ɖo biba ɛ wɛ. "
"After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. ","Azǎn tɔn atɔn gbe wɛ yě wá yi mɔ ɛ ɖo sinsɛnxɔ mɛ, bɔ é ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n, ɖo sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ tɛ́ntin, bó ɖo tó ɖó yě wɛ, bó ɖo nǔ kanbyɔ́ yě wɛ, "

"When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us like this?

“Why were you searching for me?” he asked. “Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?” ,É yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Étɛ́wú mi ɖo biba mì wɛ? Mi tunwun ɖɔ un ɖó ná ɖo tɔ́ ce sín xɔ mɛ ǎ cé?” 
But they did not understand what he was saying to them. ,Yědɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ka mɔ nǔ jɛ nǔ e ɖɔ nú yě wɛ é ɖe ɔ́ mɛ ǎ. 
Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart. ,"É ka sí te, bó xwedó yě, bɔ yě wá yi Nazalɛ́ti; é nɔ́ se tónú nú yě. Nɔ tɔn ka hɛn nǔ e jɛ nɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ayi mɛ. "
"And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar–when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene– ","Jezu ɖo susu wɛ, bɔ nǔnywɛ́ tɔn ɖo jijɛ jí wɛ.

The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Christ. ,"Mɛ e ɖo fínɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ ká ko ɖo nukúnɖíɖó mɛ, bó nɔ́ ɖo linlin wɛ ɖɔ: “Jǎan wɛ ná kó nyí Klísu ɔ́ ǎ cé?” "

"Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down.

"“I tell you the truth,” he continued, “no prophet is accepted in his hometown. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, Jezu lɛ́ ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Má ɖɔ nǔgbó nú mi: è nɔ yí gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn ɖé ganjí ɖo to tɔn mɛ ǎ. "

"And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed–only Naaman the Syrian.” ","Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, ɖo gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn Elizée hwenu ɔ́, mɛ gěgé ɖo guduzɔn jɛ wɛ ɖo Izlayɛ́li, có azɔn gbɔ nú ɖokpó yětɔn ǎ; Naamáni Silíinu ɔ́ kɛ́ɖɛ́ sín azɔn wɛ gbɔ.” "
All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this. ,"Đěe yě se mɔ̌ ɔ́, xomɛ sin yě bǐ ɖo kplɔ́ngbasá ɔ́, "
"They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him down the cliff. ","bɔ yě sí te, bó dɔn ɛ yi to ɔ́ gúdo, bó kplá ɛ yi só e jí to yětɔn ɖe é ta aga ɖéé, bó ná kpíkpé e nyi dodomɛ. "
But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way. ,"Jezu ka gbɔn tɛ́ntin yětɔn, bó ɖidó. "
"Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath began to teach the people. ","Jezu yi Kafaanawúmu ɖo Galilée yíkúngban jí, bó ɖo nǔ kplɔ́n mɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ gbɔjɛzán Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn gbe. "

"In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an evil spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice, ","Dǎwe ɖé ka ɖo kplɔ́ngbasá ɔ́ hwenɛ́nu, bɔ yɛ nyanya ɖo jǐ tɔn. Dǎwe ɔ́ sú xó tlílí bó ɖɔ: "

“Be quiet!” Jesus said sternly. “Come out of him!” Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him. ,"Jezu ka ɖe gbe dó e ɖɔ: “Nɔ abwɛ̌, bó gosín dǎwe élɔ́ jí.” Yɛ nyanya ɔ́ ka zin dǎwe ɔ́ dɛ́ ɖo mɛ bǐ nukún mɛ, bó gosín jǐ tɔn, nǔ ɖěbǔ ka wa dǎwe ɔ́ ǎ. "

And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area. ,Bɔ Jezu sín nyǐkɔ gba kpé gbě énɛ́ ɔ́ bǐ jǐ. 
"Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her. ","Jezu tɔ́n sín kplɔ́ngbasá ɔ́, bó yi Sinmɔ́ɔ sín xwé gbe. Avivɔ ɖaxó ɖé ká ɖo Sinmɔ́ɔ sín asinɔ jí hwenɛ́nu, bɔ yě ɖɔ xó tɔn nú Jezu. "
"So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them. ","Jezu ka sɛkpɔ́ azinzɔnnɔ ɔ́, bó ɖe gbe dó avivɔ ɔ́, bɔ avivɔ ɔ́ kɔ́n n'i, bɔ é sí te azɔn ɖokpó, bó jɛ jǒnɔ yětɔn yí jí. "

"Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of God!” But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Christ. ","Yɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌ gosín mɛ gěgé jí, bó nɔ́ sú xó ɖɔ: “Mawu ví wɛ a nyǐ.” Lo ɔ́, Jezu nɔ wa adǎn dó yě, bó nɔ́ lɔn nú yě ní ɖɔ xó ǎ, ɖó yě tunwun ɖɔ é wɛ nyí Klísu ɔ́. "
"At daybreak Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them.

"And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, with the people crowding around him and listening to the word of God, ","É ka nɔ ɖo Mawuxó jlá wɛ gbɔn kplɔ́ngbasá lɛ́ɛ, ɖo Judée yíkúngban jí.Jezu ɖo te ɖo Jenɛzalɛ́ti tɔ tó gbe ɖokpó, bɔ mɛ gěgé nyɛ́sú i, bó ná se Mawuxó.

"he saw at the water's edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets. ","É ka mɔ tɔjíhún we ɖo tɔ ɔ́ tó, bɔ ɖɔnyitɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ko jɛ te sín mɛ, bó ɖo ɖɔ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ hú wɛ. "
"He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat. ","Jezu byɔ́ tɔjíhún e nyí Sinmɔ́ɔ tɔn é mɛ, bó byɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ ní sɛ sín tɔ ɔ́ tó kpɛɖé; é ɖésú ka jínjɔ́n ayǐ ɖo tɔjíhún ɔ́ mɛ, bó jɛ nǔ kplɔ́n mɛ lɛ́ɛ jí sɛ́ dó. "
"When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.” ","Ée é kplɔ́n nǔ yě vɔ ɔ́, é ɖɔ nú Sinmɔ́ɔ ɖɔ: “Sɛ yi tɔzan mɛ, bónú hwi kpódó hǎgbɛ́ towe lɛ́ɛ kpó ní dó ɖɔ mitɔn lɛ́ɛ tɔ, bó ná wlí hweví.” "
"Simon answered, “Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.” ","Sinmɔ́ɔ ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌si, mǐ jɛ tagba zǎn ɔ́ mɛ káká, mǐ ká mɔ nǔɖé wlí ǎ. Lo ɔ́, ée a ka ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, un ná dó ɖɔ lɛ́ɛ tɔ.” "
"When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. ","Yě ká jɛ tɔzan ɔ́ mɛ, bó dó ɖɔ lɛ́ɛ tɔ nǔgbó, bɔ hweví e yě wlí lɛ́ɛ sukpɔ́ káká, bɔ ɖɔ lɛ́ɛ jɛ kan wɛ́n jí. "
"So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.

Then Jesus said to Simon, “Don't be afraid; from now on you will catch men.” ","Mɔ̌ jɛ́n wɛ é lɛ́ kpácá hǎgbɛ́ tɔn Zebeɖée ví, Jaki kpódó Jǎan kpó ɔ́ nɛ́.

"So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him. ","Yě ká kun tɔjíhún yětɔn lɛ́ɛ wá jɛ agě jǐ, bó jó nǔ bǐ dó, lobo xwedó Jezu. "
"While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.” ","Jezu ka wá ɖo toxo ɖaxó ɖé mɛ, bɔ nya ɖé wá xwetɔ́n, bɔ gudu kpé wú tɔn bǐ.

"Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!” And immediately the leprosy left him. ","Jezu ka dlɛ́n alɔ, bó ɖó wǔ tɔn, bó ɖɔ: “Un jló, azɔn towe ní gbɔ.” Tlóló ɔ́, nya ɔ́ sín azɔn gbɔ. "
"Then Jesus ordered him, “Don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.” ","Jezu ka dó sɛ́n n'i ɖɔ: “Ma ɖɔ nú mɛɖé cáwún ó, lo ɔ́, sɔ́ lě e a ɖe ɔ́ yi xlɛ́ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, bó ná wǔsláslá sín agban e xó Mɔyízi ɖɔ é, bó ná dó ɖe xlɛ́ mɛ bǐ ɖɔ azɔn towe gbɔ nǔgbó.” "
"Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses. ","É ká ɖɔ mɔ̌ có nyǐkɔ Jezu tɔn lɛ́ ɖo gbigba kpé d'é jí wɛ, bɔ mɛ lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ nyi ahwan wá se xó tɔn, bónú é ná gbɔ azɔn nú yě. "
But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed. ,"Jezu ka nɔ yi cí fí e mɛɖé má ɖe ǎ é, bó nɔ́ ɖo ɖɛ xo wɛ. "
"One day as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law, who had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem, were sitting there. And the power of the Lord was present for him to heal the sick. ","Jezu ɖo nǔ kplɔ́n mɛ wɛ gbe ɖokpó, bɔ Falizyɛn ɖé lɛ́ɛ kpódó sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ ɖé lɛ́ɛ kpó wá jínjɔ́n akpá tɔn.

Some men came carrying a paralytic on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus. ,"Mɛ ɖé lɛ́ɛ ká sɔ́ nya ayǐsónɔ ɖé ɖó zan jí, bó wá xwetɔ́n, bó ɖo lě e yě ná wa gbɔn, bó ná sɔ́ ɛ byɔ́ xɔ e mɛ Jezu ɖe é mɛ, bó ná sɔ́ ɛ ɖó nukɔn tɔn ɔ́ ba wɛ. "
"When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus. ","Ée ahwan e kplé dó Jezu ɔ́ sukpɔ́ káká bɔ yě ma tunwun fí e yě ná zé e gbɔn yi Jezu gɔ́n é ǎ ɔ́, yě gbɔ bó xá xɔ e mɛ Jezu ɖe ɔ́ ta, bó kɔ́n xɔ ɔ́ ɖo akpá ɖokpó, bɔ azinzɔnnɔ ɔ́ ɖo zan jí, bɔ yě zé e gbɔn fínɛ́ yi jɛ Jezu sá mɛ, ɖo mɛ lɛ́ɛ tɛ́ntin.

"When Jesus saw their faith, he said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven.” ","Ée Jezu mɔ lě e yě ɖi nǔ sɔ́ é ɔ́, é ɖɔ nú azinzɔnnɔ ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Xɔ́ntɔn ce, è sɔ́ hwɛ towe lɛ́ɛ kɛ we.” "
"The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, “Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?” ","Sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpódó Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ kpán ka jɛ linlin jí ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌ ka nyí nya élɔ́, bó nɔ́ nylá nu dó Mawu wú mɔ̌?

"Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts? ","Jezu ka mɔ nǔ jɛ linlin yětɔn lɛ́ɛ wú, bó yí xó, lobo kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Aniwútu mi ka ɖo nǔ mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn lɛ́ɛ lin dó ayi mɛ wɛ? "
"Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’? ","Ényí è ɖɔ: ‘È sɔ́ hwɛ towe lɛ́ɛ kɛ we,’ abǐ: ‘Sí te bó ɖi zɔnlin’ ɔ́, ɖě tɛ́ ka bɔ kun hú ɖě? "
"But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins....” He said to the paralyzed man, “I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.” ","Lo ɔ́, un jló ɖɔ mi ní tunwun ɖɔ nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́, ɖó acɛ e sɔ́ hwɛ kɛ mɛ ɖo ayǐkúngban jí é.” Ée é ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, é wá ɖɔ nú ayǐsónɔ ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Un ɖe gbe nú we, sí te, sɔ́ zan towe, bó yi xwé.” "
"Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and went home praising God. ","Azɔn ɖokpó ɔ́, ayǐsónɔ ɔ́ sí te ɖo yě bǐ nukún mɛ, bó sɔ́ zan e jí è sɔ́ ɛ mlɔ́ ɔ́, bó ɖidó xwé, lobo jɛ susu kpa nú Mawu jí. "
"Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, “We have seen remarkable things today.” ","Ahwi xo yě bǐ, bɔ yě jɛ susu kpa nú Mawu jí. Xɛsi ɖo yě jí, bɔ yě nɔ ɖɔ: “Nǔ e mǐ ma mɔ kpɔ́n gbeɖé ǎ wɛ mǐ mɔ égbé!” "
"After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. “Follow me,” Jesus said to him, ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, Jezu tɔ́n, bó mɔ tokwɛ́yítɔ́ ɖé ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n ɖo denuzɔ́watɔ́ lɛ́ɛ xɔsá, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Levíi. Jezu ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Xwedó mì.” "
"and Levi got up, left everything and followed him. ","Bɔ Levíi sí te, bó jó nǔ bǐ dó, lobo xwedó e. "
"Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them. ",Levíi wá ylɔ́ agɔ̌ ɖaxó ɖokpó nú Jezu ɖo xwé tɔn gbe. Tokwɛ́yítɔ́ gěgé kpódó mɛ gěgé ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ kpán wá ɖo nǔ ɖu xá yě wɛ. 
"But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and ‘sinners’?” ","Bɔ Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ kpódó sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó ka jɛ nǔ hlún ɖɔ jí, bó nɔ́ kanbyɔ́ ahwanvú Jezu tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Aniwú mi nɔ ɖu nǔ, bó nɔ́ nu ahan xá tokwɛ́yítɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpódó gbɛnyanyazántɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpán?” "
"Jesus answered them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. ","Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Mɛ e ɖo ganjí lɛ́ɛ wɛ azɔngblétɔ́ nú hu dó ǎ, lo ɔ́, mɛ e ɖo azɔn jɛ wɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ nǔ tɔn hu dó. "
"I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” ","Hwɛjijɔnɔ lɛ́ɛ ylɔ́ gbé wɛ un wá ǎ, lo ɔ́ hwɛhutɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ylɔ́ gbé wɛ un wá, nú yě ná lɛ́ kɔ sín hwɛ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ gúdo.” "
"They said to him, “John's disciples often fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking.” ","Mɛ ɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ nú Jezu ɖɔ: “Jǎan sín ahwanvú lɛ́ɛ kpódó Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ tɔn lɔmɔ̌ kpán nɔ́ blá nu hwɛhwɛ, lobo nɔ xo ɖɛ; lo ɔ́, ahwanvú towe lɛ́ɛ ka nɔ ɖo nǔ ɖu wɛ, bó nɔ́ ɖo ahan nu wɛ.” "
"Jesus answered, “Can you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? ","Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi sixú ɖó mɛ e è ylɔ́ wá alɔ wlíwlí gbé lɛ́ɛ xovɛ́, hwenu e asisúnɔ ɔ́ kpó ɖo kpɔ́ xá yě ɔ́ a? "
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them,Fon
"He told them this parable: “No one tears a patch from a new garment and sews it on an old one. If he does, he will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new will not match the old. ","É ka lɛ́ dó lǒ élɔ́ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mɛ ɖé nɔ́ tlɛ́n awu yɔ̌yɔ́, bó nɔ́ sɔ́ xwɛ tɔn dó ɖɛ́ awu xóxó ná ǎ; ényí è bló mɔ̌ ɔ́, è nǎ hɛn awu yɔ̌yɔ́ ɔ́ vún; bɔ avɔxwɛ yɔ̌yɔ́ ɔ́ ká ná lɛ́ sɔgbe xá awu xóxó ɔ́ ǎ. "
"And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins, the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. ","Mɛ ɖé ka nɔ́ sɔ́ vɛ̌ɛn yɔ̌yɔ́ kɔn dó anyǔglo xóxó mɛ ǎ; ɖó nú è blǒ mɔ̌ ɔ́, vɛ̌ɛn yɔ̌yɔ́ ɔ́ ná hɛn anyǔglo xóxó ɔ́ wú, bɔ vɛ̌ɛn ɔ́ ná kɔn nyi gbě, bɔ anyǔglo lɛ́ɛ ná lá mɛ. "
"No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins. ","Lo ɔ́, vɛ̌ɛn yɔ̌yɔ́ ɔ́, anyǔglo yɔ̌yɔ́ mɛ wɛ è nɔ kɔn dó. "
"And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for he says, ‘The old is better.’ ”One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain, rub them in their hands and eat the kernels. ","Mɛ ɖé nɔ́ nu vɛ̌ɛn xóxó, bó sɔ́ nɔ́ ba ná nu vɛ̌ɛn yɔ̌yɔ́ ǎ, ɖó é nɔ́ ɖɔ: ‘Vɛ̌ɛn xóxó ɔ́ nyɔ́.’ ”É wá su gbɔjɛzán Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn gbe gbe ɖokpó, bɔ Jezu ɖo jinukúngle ɖé mɛ gbɔn dín wɛ é kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpán.

"Some of the Pharisees asked, “Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?” ","Falizyɛn ɖé lɛ́ɛ ka mɔ yě, bó kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Étɛ́wú mi ka ɖo nǔ e sɛ́n ɔ́ gbɛ́ ɖɔ è ma wa gbɔjɛzán gbe ó ɔ́ wa wɛ?” "
"Jesus answered them, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? ","Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Nǔ e Davídi wa hwenu e xovɛ́ sin é kpódó mɛ e kpó é kpó zɔn lɛ́ɛ kpán ɔ́, mi mɔ xa kpɔ́n gbeɖé ǎ cé?

"Then Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.” ",Jezu ka lɛ́ ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ wɛ kpa acɛ dó gbɔjɛzán ɔ́ nu.” 
"On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled. ","É wá su gbɔjɛzán gbe ɖěvo, bɔ Jezu yi kplɔ́ngbasá, bó ɖo nǔ kplɔ́n mɛ wɛ. Nya ɖé ká ɖo fínɛ́, bɔ alɔ tɔn ɖisí ɔ́ kú. "
"The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath.

"But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, “Get up and stand in front of everyone.” So he got up and stood there. ","Lo ɔ́, Jezu ka tunwun nǔ e lin wɛ yě ɖe ɔ́, bó ɖɔ nú nya alɔkúnánɔ ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Sí te, bó wá jɛ tɛ́ntin fí.” Bɔ nya ɔ́ sí te, bó wá nɔ te ɖo tɛ́ntin yětɔn. "
"Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?” ","Bɔ Jezu ɖɔ nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Sɛ́n mǐtɔn ná gbe ɖɔ è nǐ wa ɖagbe abǐ nyanya gbɔjɛzán gbe a? Mɛ wɛ sɛ́n ɔ́ ɖɔ è nǐ hwlɛ́n gán a, abǐ è nǐ hu mɛ?” "
"He looked around at them all, and then said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He did so, and his hand was completely restored. ","É kpɔ́n yě bǐ xaan lɛ́ dó, bó ɖɔ nú nya ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Dlɛ̌n alɔ towe.” Bɔ nya ɔ́ dlɛ́n alɔ, bɔ alɔ ɔ́ jɛ tɛn tɔn mɛ. "
But they were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus. ,"Xomɛ ka sin yě tlala, bɔ yě jɛ wě ɖe dó nǔ e yě ná wa xá Jezu ɔ́ wú jí. "
"One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God. ","Jezu yi ɖɛ xo gbé gbe ɖokpó ɖo só ɖé jí, bó xo ɖɛ zǎn mɛ káká bɔ ayǐ hɔ́n. "
"When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles: ","Ée ayǐ wá hɔ́n ɔ́, é ylɔ́ ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ, bó cyán mɛ wěwe ɖo yě mɛ, bó sun nyǐ yě ɖɔ mɛsɛ́dó: "

"The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart.

"He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built.

"But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”When Jesus had finished saying all this in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum. ","Amɔ̌, mɛ e ɖótó xó ce, bó ma bló ɖ'é jí ǎ ɔ́ cí nya e mɛ xɔ nyi ayǐkúngban jí ma kun do, cóbó dó xɔ ɔ́ do ǎ ɔ́ ɖɔhun; ayǐsun wá sa yi gba dó xɔ ɔ́ wú, bɔ tlóló jɛ́n xɔ ɔ́ mu, bó hánnyá bǐ.”Ée Jezu ɖɔ xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ nú mɛ e ɖo tó ɖó e wɛ lɛ́ɛ vɔ ɔ́, é yi Kafaanawúmu.

"There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die. ","Đo fínɛ́ ɔ́, sɔ́ja kanwekogán Hlɔ̌ma tomɛ tɔn ɖé ka ɖó mɛsɛntɔ́ vívɛ́ná ɖokpó, bɔ mɛsɛntɔ́ ɔ́ ɖo azɔn jɛ wɛ, bó ɖo kúdonu. "
"The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant. ","Ée è ɖɔ Jezu sín xó bɔ é se ɔ́, é sɛ́ tomɛxó Judée tɔn ɖé lɛ́ɛ dó gɔ̌n tɔn, nú yě ní sa vo n'i ɖɔ ní kɛnklɛ́n bó wá hwlɛ́n mɛsɛntɔ́ émítɔn. "
"When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, “This man deserves to have you do this, ","Ée yě wá Jezu gɔ́n ɔ́, yě sa vo n'i ɖaxó ɖɔ jí: “É jɛ xá ɖɔ a nǐ ná ɛ nǔ e byɔ́ wɛ é ɖe ɔ́, "
because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.” ,ɖó é yí wǎn nú akɔta mǐtɔn
"So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: “Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. ","Jezu ka xwedó yě, bó kó sɛ yá xwé ɔ́, bɔ sɔ́ja kanwekogán ɔ́ sɛ́ xɔ́ntɔn tɔn ɖé lɛ́ɛ dó, nú yě yi ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ, ma xaji jɛ tagba ó, ɖó un nyí mɛɖé nú a nǎ wá xwé ce gbe ǎ. "
"That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ un mɔ ɖɔ un kún nyí mɛɖé, bó sixú wá gɔ̌n towe ó. Bo kɛ nu ɖokpó kpowun, bónú azɔn ná gbɔ nú mɛsɛntɔ́ ce. "
"For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” ","Đó nyɛ ɖésúnɔ ɔ́, mɛɖomɛglɔ́ wɛ nú mì, bɔ sɔ́ja ka ɖo acɛ ce mɛ; un ɖɔ nú mɛ ɖě ɖɔ: ‘Yi’ ɔ́, é nɔ́ yi; un ɖɔ nú mɛ ɖěvo ɖɔ: ‘Wǎ’ ɔ́, é nɔ wá; un ka ɖɔ nú mɛsɛntɔ́ ce ɖɔ: ‘Blǒ lě’ ɔ́, é nɔ́ bló.” "
"When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, “I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.” ","Ée Jezu se xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, sɔ́ja kanwekogán ɔ́ sín nǔ nyɔ́ nukún tɔn mɛ káká, bɔ é lílɛ́ kpan nukɔn ahwan e xwedó e ɔ́, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Ma ɖɔ nú mi, ɖo Izlayɛ́li ɖésú ɔ́, un mɔ mɛɖé, bɔ é ɖó nǔɖiɖi lěhunkɔtɔn ǎ.” "
Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well. ,"Ée mɛ e sɔ́ja kanwekogán ɔ́ sɛ́ dó lɛ́ɛ lɛ́ kɔ wá yi xwé ɔ́, yě mɔ mɛsɛntɔ́ ɔ́, bɔ azɔn ko gbɔ n'i bǐ sésé. "
"Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him. ","Énɛ́ gúdo ɔ́, Jezu wá xwe to e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Nayinu é mɛ. Ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpódó mɛ gěgé ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ kpó ka zɔn xá ɛ. "
"As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out–the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her. ","Hwenu e é wá ja to ɔ́ hɔn nukɔn jɛ gbé ɔ́, é mɔ è xwe cyɔ ɖé ɖi gbé, bɔ é nyí vǐɖokpónɔ asúkúsi ɖé tɔn, bɔ to ɔ́ mɛ nu lɛ́ɛ gěgé nyi ahwan xwedó asúkúsi ɔ́. "
"When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, “Don't cry.” ","Ée Aklúnɔ mɔ asúkúsi ɔ́ é ɔ́, nǔ tɔn blá wǔ n'i, bɔ é ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Ma sɔ́ ya avǐ ɖě ó.” "
"Then he went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. He said, “Young man, I say to you, get up!” ","Jezu ka sɛ yá nǔ e jí è sɔ́ cyɔ ɔ́ mlɔ́ é, bó ɖó alɔ wú, bɔ mɛ e hɛn cyɔ ɔ́ lɛ́ɛ nɔ te. Jezu ka ɖɔ: “Dɔ̌nkpɛvú, sí te, un ɖe gbe tɔn nú we.” "
"The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother. ","Dɔ̌nkpɛvú e kú ɔ́ ka fɔ́n jínjɔ́n ayǐ, bó jɛ xó ɖɔ jí, bɔ Jezu ɖɔ nú nɔ tɔn ɖɔ: “Vǐ towe ɖíe.” "
"They were all filled with awe and praised God. “A great prophet has appeared among us,” they said. “God has come to help his people.” ","Xɛsi jɛ mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ jí, bɔ yě nɔ kpa susu nú Mawu, bó nɔ́ ɖɔ: “Gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn ɖaxó ɖokpó ɖíe tɔ́n ɖo mǐ mɛ e; Mawu wá ba togun tɔn kpɔ́n.” "
This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country. ,"Nǔ énɛ́ e Jezu wa ɔ́ sín xó gba kpé Judée gbé ɔ́ bǐ jǐ, bó lɛ́ gba kpé to e lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó e lɛ́ɛ bǐ mɛ. "
"John's disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them, ","Jǎan sín ahwanvú lɛ́ɛ wlí nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ sésé ɖɔ n'i; é ka ylɔ́ mɛ we ɖo yě mɛ, "
"he sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?” ","bó sɛ́ yě dó Aklúnɔ gɔ́n, nú yě yi kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Hwi wɛ nyí mɛ e ɖó ná wá, bɔ mǐ ɖo te kpɔ́n é a, abǐ mɛ ɖěvo wɛ mǐ ná nɔ te kpɔ́n?” "
"When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, ‘Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?’ ” ","Ée yě yi gɔ̌n tɔn ɔ́, yě ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Jǎan Yɛhwesinlɛnúmɛtɔ́ wɛ sɛ́ mǐ dó, bónú mǐ ná wá kanbyɔ́ we ɖɔ: ‘Hwi wɛ nyí mɛ e mǐ ɖo te kpɔ́n bɔ é ná wá é a, abǐ mɛ ɖěvo wɛ mǐ ná nɔ te kpɔ́n?’ ” "
"At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind. ","Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, Jezu ka gbɔ azɔn nú mɛ gěgé; é gbɔ azɔn nú mɛ e ɖo wǔvɛ́ mɔ wɛ lɛ́ɛ, bó nya yɛ nyanya sín mɛ gěgé jí, lobo hun nukún nú nukúntíntɔ́nnɔ gěgé. "
"So he replied to the messengers, “Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor. ","É yí gbe nú mɛ e Jǎan sɛ́ dó lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Mi yi ɖɔ nǔ e mi se lɛ́ɛ kpódó nǔ e mi mɔ lɛ́ɛ kpó nú Jǎan: nukúntíntɔ́nnɔ lɛ́ɛ ɖo nukúnnú mɔ wɛ, sékúnɔ lɛ́ɛ ɖo zɔnlin ɖi wɛ, gudunɔ lɛ́ɛ sín wǔtu ɖo te jɛ wɛ, tókúnɔ lɛ́ɛ ɖo nǔ se wɛ, è ɖo mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ fɔ́n wá gbɛ wɛ, bó ɖo Wɛn Ɖagbe Mawu tɔn jlá wamamɔnɔ lɛ́ɛ wɛ. "
Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me.” ,Nǔ nyɔ́ nú mɛ e sín nǔɖiɖi ma ná jɛ ayǐ ɖó nyɛ wútu ǎ lɛ́ɛ.” 
"After John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: “What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind? ","Ée wɛnsagun Jǎan tɔn lɛ́ɛ ka lɛ́ kɔ ɖidó ɔ́, Jezu jɛ Jǎan xó ɖɔ nú togun ɔ́ jí ɖɔ: “Ani mi ka yi kpɔ́n ɖo gbětótló mɛ? Fántín ɖé wɛ mi mɔ bɔ jɔhɔn ɖo dǐndán wɛ a? Éeǒ. "
"If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces. ","Étɛ́ mi ka tɔ́n bó yi kpɔ́n? Mɛ ɖé wɛ bó dó awu xɔ akwɛ́ a? Éɖíe mɛ e nɔ dó awu xɔ akwɛ́, bó nɔ́ ɖo gbɛ ɖu wɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, hɔnmɛ wɛ yě nɔ́ nɔ e. "
"But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. ","Ani wɛ mi ka yi kpɔ́n? Gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn ɖé wɛ a? Ɛɛn! Ma ɖɔ nú mi, mɛ e hú gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn ɔ́ wɛ. "
"This is the one about whom it is written: “ ‘I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.’ ","Jǎan wɛ nyí mɛ e xó ɖɔ wɛ Mawuxówéma ɖe ɔ́, bó ɖɔ: ‘Wɛnsagun ce ɖíe un sɛ́ dó e, é ná jɛ nukɔn nú we, bó ná bló ali ɖó nú we.’ ” "
"I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.” ","Má ɖɔ nǔgbó nú mi: “Mɛ e tɔ́n sín nyɔ̌nu xo mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, ɖěbǔ hú gǎn Jǎan Yɛhwesinlɛnúmɛtɔ́ ǎ; é ka ɖo mɔ̌ có mɛ e hwe hú mɛ bǐ ɖo axɔ́súɖuɖu Mawu tɔn mɛ ɔ́ hú gǎn Jǎan. "
"(All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus' words, acknowledged that God's way was right, because they had been baptized by John. ","Togun ɔ́ bǐ kpódó tokwɛ́yítɔ́ e Jǎan lɛ yɛhwesin ná lɛ́ɛ kpó se xó ɔ́, bó mɔ ɖɔ hwɛjijɔnɔ wɛ nyí Mawu. "
"But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.) ","Lo ɔ́, Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ kpódó sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpán ka gbɛ́ nǔ e Mawu jló nú yě é, lobo lɔn nú Jǎan lɛ yɛhwesin nú yě ǎ.” "
"“To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like? ",Jezu lɛ́ ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌ wú wɛ un ka ná jlɛ́ gbɛtɔ́ din tɔn lɛ́ɛ dó? Mɛ̌ wɛ yě ɖi? 
"They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: “ ‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.’ ","Yě ɖi yɔkpɔ́vú e nɔ jínjɔ́n tokplétɛn bó nɔ́ ɖo ɖiɖɔ sɛ́ dó gbɛ̌ yětɔn ɖě lɛ́ɛ wɛ ɖɔ: ‘Mǐ kún kpete dó ji awǎjijɛ han, bɔ mi gbɛ́ we ɖú; mǐ ji nǔwamɛ han, bɔ mi gbɛ́ avǐ ya.’ "
"For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’ ","Đó Jǎan Yɛhwesinlɛnúmɛtɔ́ wá, é nɔ ɖu nǔ ǎ, é ka nɔ nu vɛ̌ɛn ǎ, bɔ mi nɔ ɖɔ: ‘Yɛ nyanya wɛ ɖo jǐ tɔn.’ "
"The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and “sinners.” ’ ","Nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ ká wá, bó nɔ́ ɖu nǔ, bó nɔ́ nu vɛ̌ɛn, bɔ mi ɖɔ: ‘Nya élɔ́ ɔ́, adɔtɔ́nɔ wɛ, vɛ̌ɛnnutɔ́ wɛ, tokwɛ́yítɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpódó gbɛnyanyazántɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpó sín xɔ́ntɔn wɛ.’ "
But wisdom is proved right by all her children.” ,"Lo ɔ́, mɛ e nyí nǔnywɛ́ ví lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ gbo gbě nú nǔnywɛ́.” "
"Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table. ","Falizyɛn ɖé ka wá ylɔ́ Jezu ɖɔ é ní wá ɖu nǔ ɖo émí gɔ́n. Jezu ka yi Falizyɛn ɔ́ xwé, bó sɔ́ tɛnmɛ, bó ná ɖu nǔ. "
"When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume, ","Nyɔ̌nu gbɛnyanyazántɔ́ ɖé ka ɖo to ɔ́ mɛ; ée é se ɖɔ Jezu ɖo nǔ ɖu wɛ ɖo Falizyɛn ɔ́ xwé ɔ́, é hɛn célu wǎnɖagbenɔ go ɖokpó wá.

"“Two men owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. ","Jezu ɖɔ: “Nya ɖé tíin, bɔ mɛ we ɖu axɔ́ dó e. Mɛ nukɔntɔn ɔ́ ɖu gankwɛ́ afɔwe kanwe ko (500) dó e; mɛ wegɔ́ ɔ́, ɖu gankwɛ́ kanɖé wǒ (50) dó e. "
"Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?” ","Yě ká ɖó nǔ e yě ná dó sú axɔ́ énɛ́ ɔ́ ná é ǎ, bɔ nya ɔ́ sɔ́ akwɛ́ ɔ́ kɛ yě mɛ we lɛ́ɛ. Đo mɛ we énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɔ́, mɛ̌ ka ná yí wǎn nú nya ɔ́ hú mɛ ɖě?” "
"Simon replied, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled.” “You have judged correctly,” Jesus said. ",Sinmɔ́ɔ ka yí gbe ɖɔ: “Nyɛ mɔ ɖɔ mɛ e é zě axɔ́ gěgé kɛ é wɛ.” Jezu ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “A yǐ gbe ɖó ganjí.” 
"Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. ","Jezu ka lílɛ́ kpan nukɔn nyɔ̌nu ɔ́, bó ɖɔ nú Sinmɔ́ɔ ɖɔ: “A ma mɔ nyɔ̌nu élɔ́ a?

"You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet. ","A kí si nú mì ǎ, lo ɔ́, éyɛ́ ɔ́, sín hwenu e un ko byɔ́ fí ɔ́, é gɔn si kí nú afɔ ce lɛ́ɛ ǎ. "
"You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. ","A kɔn ami dó ta nú mì ǎ, éyɛ́ ka kɔn célu wǎnɖagbenɔ dó afɔ ce lɛ́ɛ wú. "
"Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven–for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little.” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, ma ɖɔ nú we: è sɔ́ hwɛ tobutóbú e é hu lɛ́ɛ kɛ ɛ, ɖó wǎn yíyí ɖaxó e é ɖó ɔ́ wútu.

"Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” ",Jezu ka ɖɔ nú nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ ɖɔ: “È sɔ́ hwɛ towe lɛ́ɛ kɛ we.” 
"The other guests began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?” ","Mɛ e ɖo nǔ ɖu xá Jezu wɛ lɛ́ɛ ka jɛ ɖiɖɔ dó xomɛ jí ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌ ka nyí mɛ élɔ́, bó nɔ́ sɔ́ hwɛ kɛ mɛ?” "
"Jesus said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him, ","Jezu ka ɖɔ nú nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Nǔ e a ɖi ɔ́ hwlɛ́n we gán.

and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out,Fon
"Joanna the wife of Cuza, the manager of Herod's household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means. ","Jani e nyí Cúza nǔjíkpɔ́ntɔ́ Elódu tɔn sín asi é, Suzánu, kpódó nyɔ̌nu gěgé ɖěvo ɖé lɛ́ɛ kpán, bɔ yě nɔ́ sɔ́ nǔ e yě ɖó lɛ́ɛ dó dó alɔ Jezu kpódó ahwanvú tɔn wěwe lɛ́ɛ kpán. "
"While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable: ","Mɛ gěgé gosín to lɛ́ɛ mɛ, to lɛ́ɛ mɛ, bó nyi ahwan wá Jezu gɔ́n. Ée mɛ lɛ́ɛ wá sukpɔ́ ɔ́, é dó lǒ élɔ́ dó ɖɔ xó nú yě, bó ɖɔ: "
"“A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds of the air ate it up. ","“Nya ɖé tɔ́n gbe ɖokpó, bó yi nǔkún tɔn hú gbé. Hwenu e é ɖo nǔkún ɔ́ hú gbɔn gle ɔ́ mɛ wɛ ɔ́, ɖě yi jɛ ali jí, bɔ è gbɔn jí, lobɔ xɛ lɛ́ɛ cyán ɖu. "
"Some fell on rock, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture. ","Đě wá jɛ awǐnnyakan mɛ, fí e kɔ́ gěgé ɖé ma ɖe ǎ é; ée yě wú ɔ́, yě fyɔ́ tlóló, ɖó yě mɔ fífá ǎ. "
"Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. ","Đě lɛ́ jɛ wundonu, bɔ ée yě jɛ wǔwú jí ɔ́, wun lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌ wú, bó vun blá yě. "
"Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.” When he said this, he called out, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.” ","Đě wá jɛ ayǐkúngban ɖagbe jí; énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ wú, bó sɛ́n, bɔ nǔkún ɖokpó ná nǔkún mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn donu kanwe ko (100).” Ée Jezu ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, é zé gbe yi jǐ, bó sú ta nú lǒ ɔ́, bó ɖɔ: “Mɛ e ɖó tó bó ná dó se nǔ ná ɔ́ ní ɖótó bó se.” "
His disciples asked him what this parable meant. ,Ahwanvú Jezu tɔn lɛ́ɛ ka wá kan nǔ byɔ́ Jezu dó nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ lǒ énɛ́ ɔ́ ɖe ɔ́ wú. 
"He said, “The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, “ ‘though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.’ ","É ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Axɔ́súɖuɖu Mawu tɔn sín nǔbúdo lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ è hun xlɛ́; lo ɔ́, mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, lǒ mɛ wɛ è nɔ ɖɔ xó tɔn nú yě dó.

“This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. ,"“Lǒ e un dó ɔ́, tínmɛ tɔn ɖíe: nǔkún ɔ́, Mawuxó ɔ́ wɛ. "
"Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. ","Nǔkún e jɛ ali jí lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mɛ e nɔ se Mawuxó ɔ́, bɔ awǒvi nɔ́ wá ɖe sín ayi yětɔn mɛ lɛ́ɛ é wɛ; ɖó, yě tá wá ɖi nǔ, bónú Mawu ná hwlɛ́n yě gán. "
"Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away. ","Nǔkún e jɛ awǐnnyakan mɛ lɛ́ɛ é ɔ́, mɛ e nɔ se Mawuxó ɔ́, lobo nɔ yí kpódó xomɛhunhun kpán lɛ́ɛ wɛ; lo ɔ́, xó ɔ́ nɔ lí dǒ ɖo ayi yětɔn mɛ ǎ, yě nɔ́ ɖi nǔ nú azǎn ɖé; bɔ nǔxámɛ hwenu wá su ɔ́, yě nɔ́ jó agɔ. "
"The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life's worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature. ","Nǔkún e jɛ wundonu lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mɛ e nɔ se Mawuxó ɔ́, bó nɔ́ ɖidó lɛ́ɛ é wɛ; yě nɔ́ jó yěɖée dó, bɔ nǔlinkpɔ́n, dɔkun, kpódó vǐví gbɛmɛ fí tɔn kpó nɔ vun blá xó ɔ́ ɖo ayi yětɔn mɛ, bɔ sínsɛ́n yětɔn nɔ zin ǎ.

"But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.

"“No one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, he puts it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light.

"For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open. ","Đó nǔ ɖěbǔ ɖo nǔglɔ́ ɔ́, é ná wá jɛ wěxo agbawungba; nǔ ɖěbǔ ka nɔ wi mɛ ɔ́, é ná wá wěziza nu. "
"Therefore consider carefully how you listen.

"Now Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd. ","Jezu sín nɔ kpódó Jezu sín nɔví lɛ́ɛ kpó ka wá gɔ̌n tɔn; lo ɔ́, yě sixú yi fí e é ɖe ɔ́ ǎ, ɖó gbɛtɔ́ sukpɔ́. "
"Someone told him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.” ","Mɛ ɖé ka wá ɖɔ nú Jezu ɖɔ: “Nɔ towe kpódó nɔví towe lɛ́ɛ kpó ɖo hɔnto, bó ɖo biba we wɛ.” "

"One day Jesus said to his disciples, “Let's go over to the other side of the lake.” So they got into a boat and set out. ","É ka wá su gbe ɖokpó, bɔ Jezu kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó byɔ́ tɔjíhún ɖé mɛ, bɔ é ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi nú mǐ nǎ yi agě ɖě ɔ́ jí,” bɔ yě ɖidó. "
"As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger. ","Hwenu e yě ɖo yiyi wɛ ɖo tɔ ɔ́ jí ɔ́, Jezu wlí amlɔ.

"The disciples went and woke him, saying, “Master, Master, we're going to drown!” He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm. ","Yě sɛ yá Jezu, bó fɔ́n ɛ, lobo ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌si! Mɛ̌si! Mǐ ɖo nǎ dɔn wɛ.” Jezu ka fɔ́n, bó wa adǎn dó jɔhɔn ɔ́, kpódó xu e ɖo zǐngídi jí é kpó, bɔ yě bǐ xwɛ, bɔ fí bǐ cí tóó. "
"“Where is your faith?” he asked his disciples. In fear and amazement they asked one another, “Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him.” ","É ka wá kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Lě e mi ɖi nǔ gbɔn ɔ́ ɖíe a?” Nǔ énɛ́ ɔ́ kpácá yě, bɔ xɛsi jɛ yě jí, bɔ yě jɛ ɖiɖɔ nú yěɖée jí ɖɔ: “Mɛ nǎhún ka nyí nya élɔ́, bó nɔ́ ɖe gbe dó jɔhɔn kpódó tɔ kpó, bɔ yě nɔ́ se gbe n'i?” "
"They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee. ",Yě ká wá jɛ Jelazáanu lɛ́ɛ sín to e kpan nukɔn Galilée é mɛ. 
"When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. ","Ée Jezu jɛ te sín tɔjíhún ɔ́ mɛ wá agě jí ɔ́, nya to ɔ́ mɛ nu ɖé wá kpé e.

"When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torture me!” ","Hwenu e é mɔ Jezu ɔ́, é jɛ xó sú jí, bó jɛ kpo ɖo nukɔn tɔn, bó zé gbe yi jǐ, bó ɖɔ: “Étɛ́ wɛ nyɛ kpódó hwi kpó kpédó, Jezu Mawu Ajalɔ̌nlɔn ví?

"For Jesus had commanded the evil spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places. ","Nya ɔ́ ɖɔ mɔ̌, ɖó Jezu ɖe gbe dó yɛ nyanya ɔ́ ɖɔ ní gosín jǐ tɔn.

"Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” “Legion,” he replied, because many demons had gone into him. ","Jezu ka kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Nɛ̌ wɛ nyǐkɔ towe nɔ nyí?” Bɔ é yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Ahwan wɛ un nyí,” ɖó yɛ nyanya gěgé wɛ ɖo nya ɔ́ jí. "
And they begged him repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss. ,Bɔ yɛ nyanya énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ jɛ vo sa nú Jezu jí ɖɔ é ní má nya émí yi dó do gɔngɔn mɛ ó. 
"A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into them, and he gave them permission. ","Aglǔzahwan ɖaxó ɖé ka ɖo sókan mɛ fínɛ́, bó ɖo nǔ ba ɖu wɛ.

"When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned. ","Azɔn ɖokpó ɔ́, yɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ gosín dǎwe ɔ́ jí, bó byɔ́ aglǔza lɛ́ɛ mɛ, bɔ aglǔza lɛ́ɛ bɛ́ wezun sín só ɔ́ jí, bó kɔn nyi xu mɛ, bó kú tɔ. "
"When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, ","Ée aglǔzanyitɔ́ lɛ́ɛ mɔ nǔ énɛ́ e jɛ ɔ́, yě hɔn, bó yi ɖɔ nǔ e jɛ nɛ́ lɛ́ɛ nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖo toxo ɔ́ mɛ kpódó gletoxo lɛ́ɛ mɛ kpó. "
"and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. ","Bɔ mɛ lɛ́ɛ tɔ́n, bó wá kpɔ́n nǔ e jɛ é.

Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured. ,Mɛ e ɖo tɛn tɔn mɛ bó mɔ lě e Jezu gbɔ azɔn nú yɛnyanyanɔ ɔ́ gbɔn lɛ́ɛ wlí bǐ ɖɔ nú mɛ e wá lɛ́ɛ. 
"Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left. ","Lo ɔ́, mɛ e ɖo gbě énɛ́ ɔ́ jí lɛ́ɛ bǐ dó kɛnklɛ́n nú Jezu ɖɔ é ní gosín ayǐkúngban émítɔn jí, ɖó xɛsi ɖaxó ɖé jɛ yě jí. Jezu ka byɔ́ tɔjíhún mɛ, bó gosín yě gɔ̌n. "
"The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, ",Nya e jí yɛ nyanya gosín ɔ́ ka sa vo nú Jezu ɖɔ émí ná xwedó e. Jezu ka lɛ́ kɔ n'i bó ɖɔ: 
“Return home and tell how much God has done for you.” So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him. ,"“Lɛ̌ kɔ yi xwé towe gbe, bó ɖɔ nǔ e Mawu wa nú we lɛ́ɛ bǐ.” Nya ɔ́ ka ɖidó, bó jɛ nǔ e Jezu wa n'i é bǐ jlá jí gbɔn to ɔ́ bǐ mɛ. "
"Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him. ","Hwenu e Jezu lɛ́ kɔ wá ɔ́, mɛ lɛ́ɛ nyi ahwan wá kpé e, ɖó yě bǐ wɛ ko ɖo te kpɔ́n ɛ. "
"Then a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house ","Dǎwe ɖé ka wá xwetɔ́n, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Jayilɔ́si, bɔ é nyí kplɔ́ngbasá Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn sín gǎn. É jɛ kpo ɖo Jezu nukɔn, bó sa vo n'i ɖɔ ní wá xwé émítɔn gbe, "
"because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him. ","ɖó ɖyɔ̌vǐvú ɖokpó géé é ɖó, bɔ é ko ɖó xwe wěwe mɔ̌ ɔ́ ɖo kúdonu. Hwenu e Jezu xweyǐgbe ɔ́, mɛ e tɛ́ntin é ɖe lɛ́ɛ sukpɔ́ káká, bó ɖo fyɔ́nfyɔ́n ɛ wɛ gbɔn fí bǐ. "
"And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her. ","Nǎwe ɖé ka ɖo fínɛ́. Nǎwe énɛ́ kó ɖo hun ɖi wɛ sín xwe wěwe ɖíe ɖokpóó. É ná nǔ e é ɖó ɔ́ bǐ azɔngblétɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, có yě ɖě ká kpé azɔn ɔ́ wú bó gbɔ n'i ǎ. "
"She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped. ","Nǎwe ɔ́ gbɔn Jezu gúdo, bó wá ɖó alɔ awu tɔn tó, bɔ hun e ɖi wɛ é ɖe ɔ́ gbo ɖo tɛndo ɖokpó ɔ́ mɛ. "
"“Who touched me?” Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you.” ","Jezu ka kanbyɔ́ ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌ ká ɖó alɔ wǔ ce?” Yě bǐ ka jɛ gbigbɛ jí, bɔ Piyɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌si, a mɔ mɛ lɛ́ɛ lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó we, bó ɖo fyɔ́nfyɔ́n we wɛ gbɔn fí bǐ, bɔ a ka nɔ lɛ́ kanbyɔ́ ɖɔ mɛ̌ wɛ ɖó alɔ émí wú a jí.” "
"But Jesus said, “Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me.” ","Lo ɔ́, Jezu ɖɔ: “Mɛ ɖé ɖó alɔ wú ce dandan; ɖó un tunwun ɖɔ hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n ɖé tɔ́n sín wú ce.” "
"Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. ","Ée nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ mɔ ɖɔ nǔ e émí wa ɔ́ gba ɔ́, é jɛ sísɔ́sísɔ́ jí, bó wá jɛ kpo ɖo Jezu nukɔn, bɔ nǔ e wú é ɖó alɔ wǔ tɔn ɔ́, kpódó lě e azɔn gbɔ n'i tlóló gbɔn é kpó ɔ́, é wlí bǐ bó ɖɔ ɖo mɛ bǐ nukún mɛ.

"Then he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.” ","Jezu ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Vǐ ce, nǔɖiɖi towe zɔ́n bɔ azɔn towe gbɔ. Yi dó fífá mɛ!” "
"While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. “Your daughter is dead,” he said. “Don't bother the teacher any more.” ","Xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ wɛ Jezu ɖe kɛ́ɖɛ́ bɔ mɛɖé gosín Jayilɔ́si xwé, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Vǐ towe kó kú, ma sɔ́ dó tagba nú mɛ̌si ɔ́ ó.” "
"Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, “Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.” ","Lo ɔ́, ée Jezu se mɔ̌ ɔ́, é ɖɔ nú Jayilɔ́si ɖɔ: “Ma ɖi xɛsi ó, vɛ̌ ko ɖi nǔ kpowun, énɛ́ ɔ́, azɔn na gbɔ nú vǐ towe.” "
"When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child's father and mother. ","Ée Jezu wá Jayilɔ́si xwé ɔ́, é lɔn nú mɛɖé byɔ́ xɔ ɔ́ mɛ xá ɛ zɛ Piyɛ́ɛ kpó Jǎan kpó Jaki kpó, vǐtɔ́ ɔ́ kpódó vǐnɔ kpó wú ǎ. "
"Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. “Stop wailing,” Jesus said. “She is not dead but asleep.” ","Mɛ bǐ ɖo avǐ ya wɛ, bó ɖo alě ná wɛ ɖó vǐ ɔ́ wútu. Jezu ka ɖɔ: “Mi ma ya avǐ ó, vǐ ɔ́ kú ǎ; lo ɔ́, amlɔ dɔ́ wɛ é ɖe.” "
"They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. ","Yě ká jɛ cícá ɛ ko jí, ɖó yě tunwun ɖɔ vǐ ɔ́ kó kú. "
"But he took her by the hand and said, “My child, get up!” ","Éyɛ́ ká hɛn vǐ ɔ́ sín alɔ, bó ɖɔ: “Sí te!” "
"Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat. ","Bɔ vǐ ɔ́ fɔ́n, bó sí te tlóló; bɔ Jezu ná gbe ɖɔ è nǐ ná ɛ nǔɖuɖu. "
"Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases, ","É kpácá vǐtɔ́ ɔ́ kpó vǐnɔ ɔ́ kpó tlala, Jezu ka dó sɛ́n nú yě ɖɔ nǔ énɛ́ e jɛ ɔ́ yě ní má ɖɔ nú mɛɖé ó.Jezu kplé ahwanvú tɔn wěwe lɛ́ɛ gbe ɖokpó, bó ná yě hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n kpódó acɛ kpó, bónú yě ná nɔ nya yɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ sín mɛ lɛ́ɛ jí, bó ná nɔ́ gbɔ azɔn nú azinzɔnnɔ lɛ́ɛ.

and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. ,"É sɛ́ yě dó, nú yě ná yi jlá axɔ́súɖuɖu Mawu tɔn sín xó, bó gbɔ azɔn nú azinzɔnnɔ lɛ́ɛ. "
"He told them: “Take nothing for the journey–no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra tunic. ","É ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi jɛ ali hǔn, mi ma hɛn nǔ ɖěbǔ ó: mi ma hɛn kpogɛ ó, mi ma hɛn nǔbyɔ́ɖutɔ́ glo ó, mi ma hɛn nǔɖuɖu ó, mi ma hɛn akwɛ́ ó, mi ɖě ma ka hɛn awu we ó. "
"Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town. ","Mi jɛ xwé ɖé gbe hǔn, mi nɔ fínɛ́ káká yi jɛ hwenu e mi na tɔ́n sín to ɔ́ mɛ dó é. "
"If people do not welcome you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave their town, as a testimony against them.” ","Ényí mɛ lɛ́ɛ ma ka yí mi ǎ, bónú mi ja to ɔ́ mɛ tɔ́n sín gbe hǔn, mi xúxú afɔkɔ́ mitɔn, bó dó ɖe xlɛ́ yě ɖɔ yě wa nǔ nyi do.” "
"So they set out and went from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere. ","Mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ ka yi, bó nɔ gbɔn fí bǐ ɖo gletoxo lɛ́ɛ mɛ, bó nɔ jlá Wɛn Ɖagbe Mawu tɔn ɔ́, bó nɔ gbɔ azɔn nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ gbɔn fí bǐ. "
"Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed, because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead, ","Tokpɔngán Elódu se nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ e ɖo jijɛ wɛ lɛ́ɛ, bó sɔ́ tunwun lě e é ná bló gbɔn ɔ́ ǎ, ɖó mɛ ɖé lɛ́ɛ nɔ ɖɔ: “Jǎan Yɛhwesinlɛnúmɛtɔ́ ɔ́ wɛ fɔ́n sín kú.” "

"But Herod said, “I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?” And he tried to see him. ","Elódu ka ɖɔ: “Jǎan ɔ́, un ka ko gbo ta ɛ nɛ́! Mɛ nǎhún wɛ ka nyí mɛ e wú un ɖo nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ se dó wɛ é?” Bɔ é ɖo biba ná mɔ mɛ ɔ́ wɛ. "
"When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida, ","Ée mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ lɛ́ kɔ wá ɔ́, yě ɖɔ nǔ e yě wa lɛ́ɛ bǐ nú Jezu. É ka kplá yě jɛ zɔ ɖo to e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Bɛtisayida é sín awa jí. "
"but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing. ","Ée mɛ lɛ́ɛ mɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě jɛ gúdo tɔn. Jezu ka yí yě ganjí, bó ɖɔ xó nú yě dó axɔ́súɖuɖu Mawu tɔn ɔ́ wú, lobo lɛ́ gbɔ azɔn nú azinzɔnnɔ lɛ́ɛ. "
"Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, “Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here.” ","Hwe ɖo xɔ na yi wɛ, bɔ mɛsɛ́dó wěwe lɛ́ɛ sɛ yá ɛ, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Nyi mɛ lɛ́ɛ, nú yě ní yi gletoxo lɛ́ɛ mɛ, abǐ gle e yá fí lɛ́ɛ é ta, bó na yi ba fí ɖé nɔ, bó na yi ba nǔɖé xɔ ɖu, ɖó gblǒlǒ mɛ wɛ mì ɖe ɖo fí.” "
"He replied, “You give them something to eat.” They answered, “We have only five loaves of bread and two fish–unless we go and buy food for all this crowd.” ",Jezu ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi ɖésúnɔ ní ná nǔɖuɖu yě.” Yě ká ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Wɔ̌xúxú atɔ́ɔ́n kpódó hweví we kpán jɛ́n ɖo mǐ sí.

"(About five thousand men were there.) But he said to his disciples, “Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.” ","Đó mɛxó súnnu děgba ɖě afatɔ́n (5.000) mɔ̌ wɛ ɖo mɛ lɛ́ɛ mɛ. Jezu ka ɖɔ nú ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Mi ɖɔ nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ nú yě jínjɔ́n ayǐ sonu sonu, kanɖé wǒ (50) kanɖé wǒ (50).” "
"The disciples did so, and everybody sat down. ",Yě ɖɔ nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ bɔ yě bǐ sésé jínjɔ́n ayǐ. 
"Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to set before the people. ","Jezu ka yí wɔ̌xúxú atɔ́ɔ́n lɛ́ɛ kpódó hweví we lɛ́ɛ kpán, bó kpɔ́n jǐ, bó dó kú nú Mawu, bó kán, lobo sɔ́ nú ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ, nú yě ní má nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ. "
"They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. ","Yě bǐ ɖu nǔ, bó gɔ́ xo, bɔ nǔ e yě ɖu kpo ɔ́, è kplé bɔ é gɔ́ xasun wěwe. "
"Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, “Who do the crowds say I am?” ","É wá su gbe ɖokpó, bɔ Jezu ɖo ɖɛ xo wɛ é ɖokpónɔ, bɔ ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ wá gɔ̌n tɔn, bɔ é kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌ un ka nyí bɔ mɛ lɛ́ɛ nɔ ɖɔ?” "
"They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life.” ","Bɔ yě yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Mɛ ɖě nɔ ɖɔ hwi wɛ nyí Jǎan Yɛhwesinlɛnúmɛtɔ́, mɛ ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ ka nɔ ɖɔ hwi wɛ nyí Elíi, mɛ ɖě ká nɔ ɖɔ gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn xóxó lɛ́ɛ ɖě wɛ fɔ́n sín kú.” "
"“But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?” Peter answered, “The Christ of God.” ","É ka lɛ́ kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ lo, mɛ̌ un ka nyí bɔ mi nɔ ɖɔ?” Bɔ Piyɛ́ɛ yí xó bó ɖɔ: “Hwi wɛ nyí Klísu Mawu tɔn.” "
Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone. ,Jezu ka dó sɛ́n nú yě syɛ́nsyɛ́n ɖɔ yě ní ma ɖɔ mɛ e émí nyí ɔ́ nú mɛɖé cáwún ó. 
"And he said, “The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.” ","Jezu ka lɛ́ ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ ná ji ya ɖésú; tomɛxó lɛ́ɛ kpódó vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpó, kpódó sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpán ná gbɛ́ mì, lobo ná hu mì.

"Then he said to them all: “If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. ","Jezu lɛ́ ɖɔ nú yě bǐ ɖɔ: “Ényí mɛɖé jló ná xwedó mì hǔn, ní jó tito é ɖésúnɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ dó, bó ɖíɖá aklúzu tɔn ayǐhɔ́ngbe ayǐhɔ́ngbe, bó xwedó mì. "
"For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it. ","Đó mɛ e jló ná hwlɛ́n gbɛ éɖée tɔn gán ɔ́, gbɛ tɔn ná bú dó e; mɛ e ka ná hɛn gbɛ tɔn bú ɖó nyɛ wútu ɔ́ ná hwlɛ́n gbɛ tɔn gán. "
"What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his very self? ","Ényí mɛɖé ka ɖó nǔ e ɖo gbɛ élɔ́ mɛ ɔ́ bǐ, lobo ka dɔn, abǐ gbɛ é ɖésúnɔ tɔn ka bú dó e ɔ́, le tɛ́ wɛ ɖ'é mɛ n'i? "
"If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. ","Mɛ e nyɛ kpódó xó ce lɛ́ɛ kpó ná nyí winnyánú ná ɔ́, mɛ ɔ́ lɔmɔ̌ ná nyí winnyánú nú nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ hwenu e un ná lɛ́ kɔ wá ɖo susu ce mɛ, ɖo susu Tɔ́ ɔ́ tɔn mɛ, kpódó susu wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó tɔn mɛ é.

"About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray. ","Ée Jezu ɖɔ xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ gúdo ɔ́, azǎn ná yi tántɔn mɔ̌, bɔ é kplá Piyɛ́ɛ kpódó Jǎan kpó, kpódó Jaki kpán, bó xá só ɖé jí, bó ná yi xo ɖɛ. "

"As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, “Master, it is good for us to be here.

"When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves, and told no one at that time what they had seen. ","Ée è se gbe énɛ́ gúdo ɔ́, é wá kpo Jezu ɖokpónɔ. Nǔ énɛ́ e ahwanvú lɛ́ɛ ka mɔ ɔ́, yě hɛn dó ayi mɛ, bó ɖɔ xó ɖěbǔ nú mɛ ɖé sín hwenɛ́nu ǎ. "

"Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the evil spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father.

"And they were all amazed at the greatness of God. While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples, ","Lě e hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n Mawu tɔn d'agba sɔ ɔ́ nyí nǔɖé, bó kpácá yě tawun. Nǔ énɛ́ e Jezu jlɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɖo mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó kpácá wɛ, bɔ é ɖɔ nú ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: "

"But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it. ","Ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ka mɔ nǔ jɛ xó énɛ́ mɛ ǎ; Mawu sɔ́ hwlá dó yě, bónú yě ma mɔ nǔ jɛ mɛ ó, bɔ yě ká glá kan nǔɖé byɔ́ Jezu dó xó énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ǎ. "

"As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem. ","Hwenu e Mawu na sɔ́ Jezu sín gbɛmɛ fí ɔ́ ɖo susu wɛ, bɔ Jezu ɖidó Jeluzalɛ́mu, kpódó akɔ́nkpinkpan kpó. "

Ma ka ɖɔ nú mi: mi sɔ́ ɖo nǎ mɔ mì wɛ ɖě, káká yi jɛ gbe e gbe mi ná ɖɔ susu nú mɛ e jǎwe ɖo Aklúnɔ nyíkɔ mɛ é ǎ.”Gbɔjɛzán gbe ɖé wá su, bɔ Jezu yi nǔ ɖu gbé ɖo Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ sín gǎn ɖé xwé; mɛ e ɖo fínɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ka ɖo cicɔ ɛ wɛ. "
There in front of him was a man suffering from dropsy. ,"Nya ɖé ɖo nukɔn tɔn fínɛ́, bó ɖo jǐjízɔn jɛ wɛ. "
"Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?” ","Jezu ka yí xó, bó kanbyɔ́ sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpódó Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ kpó ɖɔ: “Đo sɛ́n mǐtɔn mɛ ɔ́, è hɛn ɔ́, è nǎ gbɔ azɔn nú mɛ gbɔjɛzán gbe a, abǐ è nǎ gɔn azɔn gbɔ nú mɛ?” "
"But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him away. ","Bɔ yě kɛ nu ǎ. Jezu ka ɖó alɔ azinzɔnnɔ ɔ́ wú, bó gbɔ azɔn n'i, lobo nyi i sɛ́ dó xwé. "
"Then he asked them, “If one of you has a son or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull him out?” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, Jezu kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌ wɛ ɖo mi mɛ bɔ vǐ tɔn abǐ nyibú tɔn ná jɛ dotɔ mɛ gbɔjɛzán gbe, bɔ é ma ná yi ɖe e tɔ́n tlóló ǎ?” "
And they had nothing to say. ,Yě ɖě ká mɔ nǔɖé ɖɔ dó xó énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ǎ. 
"When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable: ","Jezu mɔ ɖɔ mɛ e è ylɔ̌ yi jǒnɔgbé lɛ́ɛ ɖo tɛn ɖaxó mɛ ba ná jínjɔ́n wɛ, bó dó lǒ élɔ́ nú yě bǐ ɖɔ: "
"“When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited. ","“Ényí mɛɖé ylɔ́ we yi agɔ̌ ɖu gbé ɖo asikplákplá tɛnmɛ hǔn, ma yi jínjɔ́n tɛn ɖaxó mɛ ó, ɖó mɛɖé kó sixú nyí mɛjɔmɛ hú we, bɔ è nǎ ylɔ́ é lɔmɔ̌. "
"If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, ‘Give this man your seat.’ Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important place. ","Mɛ e ylɔ́ we, bó ylɔ́ é lɔmɔ̌ ɔ́ táá wá ɖɔ nú we ɖɔ: ‘Sí te, bó ná tɛn nya élɔ́’, hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, tɛnmɛ ba gbé wɛ a xwe ɖo gǔdo bǐ nɛ́, bɔ é ná nyí winnyá nú we. "
"But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you, ‘Friend, move up to a better place.’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all your fellow guests. ","Nǔ ɖo ganjí ɔ́, a yi jǒnɔ gbé ɔ́, tɛn e ɖo gǔdo bǐ é mɛ wɛ a nǎ jínjɔ́n; énɛ́ ɔ́, mɛ e ylɔ́ we ɔ́ wá mɔ we ɖo fínɛ́ ɔ́, é ná ɖɔ nú we ɖɔ: ‘Xɔ́ntɔn ce, sɛ wá nukɔn’, bɔ é ná nyí susu nú we ɖo mɛ e kpódó hwi kpó ɖo agɔ̌ ɖu ɖo fínɛ́ wɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ nukún mɛ.

"For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.” ","Đó mɛ ɖěbǔ sɔ́ éɖée su ɔ́, è nǎ sɔ́ ɛ hwe; mɛ e ka sɔ́ éɖée hwe ɔ́, è nǎ sɔ́ ɛ su.” "
"Then Jesus said to his host, “When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or relatives, or your rich neighbors; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid. ","Jezu ka wá ɖɔ nú mɛ e ylɔ́ ɛ é ɖɔ: “Ényí a jlǒ ná da mɛ nú è nǎ wá ɖu hwemɛ nǔɖuɖu, abǐ gbada nǔɖuɖu ɖo gɔ̌n towe hǔn, ma ylɔ́ xɔ́ntɔn towe lɛ́ɛ, nɔví towe lɛ́ɛ, hɛ̌nnumɔ towe lɛ́ɛ, kpódó dɔkunnɔ e ɖo xwé towe kpá lɛ́ɛ kpó ó; ɖó yě lɔ hɛn ɔ́, yě ná ylɔ́ we, bó ná sú nǔ e yě ɖu ɔ́ sín axɔ́ we.

"But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, ","Lo ɔ́, ényí a ylɔ́ agɔ̌ hǔn, ylɔ̌ wamamɔnɔ lɛ́ɛ kpódó sékúnɔ lɛ́ɛ kpó, afɔkponɔ lɛ́ɛ kpódó nukúntíntɔ́nnɔ lɛ́ɛ kpó. "
"and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, nǔ ná nyɔ́ nú we, ɖó mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ sixú wá ja axɔ́ tɔn sú we gbé ǎ; amɔ̌, Mawu ná ná ajɔ tɔn we gbe e gbe é ná fɔ́n hwɛjijɔnɔ lɛ́ɛ sín kú é.” "
"When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, “Blessed is the man who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.” ","Mɛ ɖokpó ɖo mɛ e ɖo nǔ ɖu xá Jezu wɛ lɛ́ɛ mɛ, bɔ ée é se xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, é ɖɔ nú Jezu ɖɔ: “Nǔ nyɔ́ nú mɛ e na ɖu nǔ ɖo agɔ̌ e Mawu na ylɔ́ hwenu e é ná ɖu axɔ́sú ɖo gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ nu ɔ́ tɛnmɛ é.” "
Jesus replied: “A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests. ,"Jezu ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Nya ɖé ylɔ́ agɔ̌ ɖaxó ɖokpó, bó ylɔ́ mɛ gěgé. "
"At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’ ","Ée nǔɖuɖu hwenu su ɔ́, é sɛ́ mɛsɛntɔ́ tɔn dó, nú é ná yi ɖɔ nú mɛ e è ylɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: ‘Mi wá, nǔ bǐ ko sɔgbe.’ "
"“But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, ‘I have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.’ ","Lo ɔ́, yě bǐ dó gbe ɖokpó ɔ́, bó ɖɔ sɛ́ dó e ɖɔ émí kún sixú wá ó. Mɛ nukɔntɔn ɔ́ ɖɔ sɛ́ dó e ɖɔ: ‘Un xɔ ayǐkúngban ɖokpó, bó jló ná yi kpɔ́n; kɛnklɛ́n ma sin xomɛ ó.’ "
"“Another said, ‘I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I'm on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.’ ","Mɛ ɖěvo ɖɔ: ‘Un xɔ nyibú wǒ, bó jló ná yi kpɔ́n ɖɔ yě ná sixú wa azɔ̌ ganjí a jí; kɛnklɛ́n ma sin xomɛ ó.’ "
"“Still another said, ‘I just got married, so I can't come.’ ","Mɛ ɖěvo lɛ́ ɖɔ: ‘Un kplá asi din zaanɖé; énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, un sixú wá ǎ.’ "
"“The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame.’ ","Mɛsɛntɔ́ ɔ́ lɛ́ kɔ wá, bó ɖó gbe nú gǎn tɔn.

"“ ‘Sir,’ the servant said, ‘what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.’ ","Ée mɛsɛntɔ́ ɔ́ yi bó wá ɔ́, é wá ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: ‘Gǎn ce, nǔ e a zɔ̌n ɔ́, è ko bló, có tɛn lɛ́ kpo.’ "
"“Then the master told his servant, ‘Go out to the roads and country lanes and make them come in, so that my house will be full. ","Gǎn ɔ́ ka ɖɔ nú mɛsɛntɔ́ tɔn ɔ́ ɖɔ: ‘Lɛ̌ yi gbɔn gletoxo lɛ́ɛ mɛ, bó gbɔn aliswɛ́ɛ́n lɛ́ɛ jí, bó dɔn mɛ e a nǎ mɔ lɛ́ɛ wá dandan nú xwé ce ná gɔ́.’ "
"I tell you, not one of those men who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.’ ” ","Đó ma ɖɔ nú mi: nya énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ e un ko ylɔ́ ɖ'ayǐ ɔ́, yě mɛ ɖě ná ɖu nǔɖuɖu ce ǎ.” "
"Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them he said: ","Mɛ gěgé nyi ahwan xwedó Jezu, bɔ é lílɛ́ kpan nukɔn yě, bó ɖɔ: "
"“If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters–yes, even his own life–he cannot be my disciple. ","“Ényí mɛɖé jló ná xwedó mì, bó má ka yí wǎn nú mì hú tɔ́ tɔn, nɔ tɔn, asi tɔn, vǐ tɔn lɛ́ɛ, nɔví tɔn súnnu lɛ́ɛ kpódó nɔví tɔn nyɔ̌nu lɛ́ɛ kpó, káká jɛ gbɛ é ɖésúnɔ tɔn jí ǎ ɔ́, mɛ énɛ́ sixú nyí ahwanvú ce ǎ.

And anyone who does not carry his cross and follow me cannot be my disciple. ,"Mɛ e ma ɖíɖá aklúzu tɔn, bó xwedó mì ǎ ɔ́, mɛ énɛ́ sixú nyí ahwanvú ce ǎ. "
“Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Will he not first sit down and estimate the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it? ,"Ényí mɛɖé ɖo mi mɛ, bó ɖo síngbó ná gbá wɛ ɔ́, ayǐ wɛ é ná to jínjɔ́n, bó ná lɛ́n akwɛ́ nabí e é ná zán d'é wú ɔ́ kpɔ́n hwɛ̌, bó ná kpɔ́n ɖɔ émí ɖó akwɛ́ e ná sixú wa azɔ̌ ɔ́ yi fó ɔ́ a jí.

"For if he lays the foundation and is not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule him, ","É má nyí mɔ̌ ǎ ɔ́, nú é wá dó xɔ ɔ́ do, bó ma ka sɔ́ wá kpé wú, bó gbá yi fó ǎ ɔ́, mɛ e na wá mɔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ na jɛ cícá ɛ ko jí, "
"saying, ‘This fellow began to build and was not able to finish.’ ","bó ná nɔ́ ɖɔ: ‘Mi kpɔ́n, nya ɖě ɖíe dó xɔ do, bó ma ka kpé wú bó gbá yi fó ǎ e.’ "
“Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Will he not first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand? ,"Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, axɔ́sú e ɖó ahwanfuntɔ́ děgba we afɔwó (10.000), bó ja ahwan fun xá axɔ́sú ɖěvo e ɖó ahwanfuntɔ́ adɔ̌kpo ɖokpó (20.000) gbé ɔ́, é ná to jínjɔ́n ayǐ hwɛ̌, bó ná lin tamɛ kpɔ́n ɖɔ émí ná sixú kpé ahwan xá ɛ a jí.

"In the same way, any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be my disciple. ","Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, mɛ e ná ɖo mi mɛ, bó ma ná jó dɔkun tɔn lɛ́ɛ bǐ dó ǎ ɔ́, mɛ énɛ́ sixú nyí ahwanvú ce ǎ.” "
"“Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? ","“Jɛ ɔ́, nǔ ɖagbe wɛ é nyí; ényí é ka gblé ɔ́, nɛ̌ wɛ è nǎ lɛ́ wa gbɔn n'i bɔ é ná lɛ́ nyɔ́? "
"It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; it is thrown out. “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”Now the tax collectors and “sinners” were all gathering around to hear him. ","É sɔ́ nyɔ́ nú ayǐkúngban ǎ, é ka sɔ́ lɛ́ nyɔ́ nú gle lɔ ǎ; hǔn gbě wɛ è nǎ sɔ́ kɔn nyi.

Then Jesus told them this parable: ,Jezu ka dó lǒ nú yě ɖɔ: 
“Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Does he not leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? ,"“Mɛ̌ ká ɖo mi mɛ, bónú é ɖó lɛ̌ngbɔ́ kanwe ko (100), bɔ ɖokpó bú ɖ'é mɛ ɔ́, é ma ná jó lɛ̌ngbɔ́ kanwe afɔtɔn-nukún-ɛnɛ (99) ɖě lɛ́ɛ dó nyi amagbo mɛ fí e ɖu nǔ ɖe wɛ yě ɖe é, bó ná jɛ ɖokpó e bú é gbé mɛ, káká bó ná yi mɔ ɛ ǎ? "
"And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders ","Ée é mɔ ɛ ɔ́, xomɛ hun i, bɔ é sɔ́ ɛ nyi kɔlivla mɛ "
"and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.’ ","wá xwé gbe, bó kplé xɔ́ntɔn tɔn lɛ́ɛ, kpódó mɛ e ɖo xwé tɔn kpá lɛ́ɛ kpó, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: ‘Mi j'awǎ xá mì, ɖó un mɔ lɛ̌ngbɔ́ ce e bú é.’ "
I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent. ,"Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, má ɖɔ nú mi, ényí hwɛhutɔ́ ɖokpó géé lɛ́ kɔ sín hwɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ gúdo ɔ́, awǎ e è nɔ jɛ dó ta tɔn mɛ ɖo sɛ́xwé ɔ́ nɔ hú ée è nɔ jɛ dó hwɛjijɔnɔ kanwe afɔtɔn-nukún-ɛnɛ (99) e kɔ lɛ́ sín hwɛ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ gúdo nú ma hu dó ǎ lɛ́ɛ tamɛ é.” "
"“Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Does she not light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it? ","“Abǐ nyɔ̌nu tɛ́ ká ná ɖó gankwɛ́ wǒ, bó hɛn ɖokpó bú ɖ'é mɛ ɔ́, é má ná tá zogbɛ́n, bó za xwé gbe, lobo xwetɛ́, bó ba káká bó mɔ ǎ? "
"And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.’ ","Ée é mɔ ɔ́, é kplé xɔ́ntɔn tɔn lɛ́ɛ, kpódó mɛ e ɖo xwé tɔn kpá lɛ́ɛ kpó, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: ‘Mi j'awǎ xá mì, ɖó un mɔ akwɛ́ ce e un hɛn bú é.’ "
"In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.” ","Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, má ɖɔ nú mi: ényí hwɛhutɔ́ ɖokpó géé lɛ́ kɔ sín hwɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ gúdo ɔ́, lě e wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ nɔ j'awǎ gbɔn ɔ́ nɛ́.” "
Jesus continued: “There was a man who had two sons. ,Jezu ka lɛ́ ɖɔ: “Nya ɖé ɖó vǐ súnnu we. 
"The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the estate.’ So he divided his property between them. ","Yɔkpɔ́vú ɔ́ ka ɖɔ nú tɔ́ tɔn gbe ɖokpó ɖɔ: ‘Daá, nǎ gǔ e ná nyí ce ɔ́ mì;’ bɔ tɔ́ ɔ́ ka má dɔkun tɔn nú yě. "
"“Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living. ","Azǎn ɖé jɛ ǎ, bɔ yɔkpɔ́vú ɔ́ xo nǔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ bǐ kplé, bó yi to línlín ɖé mɛ, bó zán nǔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ dó akpa mɛ. "
"After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need. ","Hwenu e é zán nǔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ bǐ vɔ ɔ́, adɔ ɖaxó ɖé tɔ́n ɖo to ɔ́ mɛ, bɔ é jɛ ya ji jí. "
"So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. ","É gbɔ bó yi jɛ kɔ nú to ɔ́ mɛ nu ɖokpó, bɔ nya ɔ́ sɛ́ ɛ dó gle tɔn ta, nú é ná nɔ́ ná nǔɖuɖu aglǔza lɛ́ɛ. "
"He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything. ","Nǔɖuɖu e aglǔza lɛ́ɛ nɔ ɖu ɔ́, ɖuɖu tɔn nɔ jló e, mɛɖé ka nɔ ná ɛ ǎ. "
"“When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father's hired men have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! ","É wá dó ayi do, bó ɖɔ dó xomɛ ɖɔ: ‘Azɔ̌watɔ́ gěgé wɛ ɖo daá ce xwé, bɔ nǔɖuɖu kpé yě kpo, bɔ nyɛ ka wá ɖo adɔ ná kú wɛ ɖo fí. "
"I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. ","Un ná sɔ́ nǔ, bó lɛ́ kɔ yi daá ce gɔ́n, bó na ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: Daá! Un hu hwɛ dó Mawu, bó hu hwɛ dó we; "

"So he got up and went to his father. “But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.

"“The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. ’ ","Vǐ ɔ́ ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: ‘Daá, un hu hwɛ dó Mawu, bó hu hwɛ dó we; un sɔ́ nyí mɛ nú a nǎ ylɔ́ mì ɖɔ vǐ ǎ.’ "
"“But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. ","Lo ɔ́, tɔ́ ɔ́ ɖɔ nú mɛsɛntɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: ‘Mi yá wǔ yi sɔ́ awu gaga e nyɔ́ ɖɛkpɛ hú ɖě lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɔ́ wá dó n'i; mi sɔ́ alɔkɛ́ dó n'i, bó dó afɔkpa n'i. "
Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate. ,"Mi yi sɔ́ nyibú wínnyáwínnyá e è sɔ́ ɖó vo, bɔ nǔɖuɖu kpé e ganjí ɔ́ wá, bó hu, nú mǐ ná ɖu agɔ̌, bó ná j'awǎ; "

So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, é ylɔ́ mɛsɛntɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó, bó kan nǔ e ɖo jijɛ wɛ é byɔ́. "
"‘Your brother has come,’ he replied, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.’ ","Mɛsɛntɔ́ ɔ́ ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: ‘Nɔví towe wɛ lɛ́ kɔ wá xwé, bɔ tɔ́ towe hu nyibú wínnyáwínnyá e è sɔ́ ɖó vo, bɔ nǔɖuɖu kpé ganjí é, ɖó é mɔ ɛ ɖo ganjí.’ "
“The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him. ,"Vǐmɛxó ɔ́ ka wlí xomɛsin, bó gbɛ́ xwé gbe byɔ́, bɔ tɔ́ ɔ́ tɔ́n, bó wá sa vo n'i ɖɔ ní byɔ́ xwé gbe. "
"But he answered his father, ‘Look! All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.

"But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!’ ","Vǐ towe énɛ́ ka yi sɔ́ dɔkun towe dó ɖu gbɛ xá agalɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, bó lɛ́ kɔ wá, bɔ a hu nyibú wínnyáwínnyá e è sɔ́ ɖó vo, bɔ nǔɖuɖu kpé ganjí é n'i.’ "
"“ ‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. ","Tɔ́ ɔ́ ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: ‘Vǐ ce, hwɛ ɔ́, tɛgbɛ wɛ a ɖo kpɔ́ xá mì, bɔ nǔ e un ɖó lɛ́ɛ bǐ nyí towe, "
"But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ ”Jesus told his disciples: “There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions.

"So he called him in and asked him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.’ ","Nya ɔ́ ka ylɔ́ ɛ, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: ‘Étɛ́ se dó wú towe wɛ un ɖe nɛ́? Wǎ xa nǔ ce lɛ́ɛ nú mì, ɖó a sɔ́ sixú nɔ nǔ ce lɛ́ɛ nu ǎ.’ "
"“The manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job.

"Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised God.Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.

For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.” ,"Đó Mawu sɛ́ nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ dó, bónú má wá ba mɛ e bú lɛ́ɛ, bó hwlɛ́n yě gán. "
"While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once.

"“He was made king, however, and returned home. Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained with it. ","“Ée è sɔ́ ɛ axɔ́sú, bɔ é lɛ́ kɔ wá xwé ɔ́, é ylɔ́ mɛsɛntɔ́ e é má akwɛ́ ná lɛ́ɛ, bó ná tunwun lě e mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó mɔ é. "

"He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out. ","É lɛ́ wá sɛ́ mɛ atɔngɔ́ ɔ́ dó, bɔ yě gblé wǔ i, bó nya ɛ tɔ́n sín vǐwungbo ɔ́ mɛ. "
"“Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.’ ","Nya ɔ́ wá ɖɔ dó xomɛ ɖɔ: ‘Nɛ̌ un ka ná wa gbɔn? Un ná sɛ́ vǐ ce vívɛ́ná ɔ́ dó kpɔ́n; afɔ nyɔ́ ɔ́, yě sixú ɖó sísí nú éyɛ́.’ "
"“But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. ‘This is the heir,’ they said. ‘Let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ ","Lo ɔ́, ée vǐwunzɔ́watɔ́ lɛ́ɛ mɔ ɛ ɔ́, yě ɖɔ ɖo yěɖée tɛ́ntin ɖɔ: ‘Vǐ e ɖo xu ɔ́ ná ɖu wɛ ɔ́ ɖíe. Mi nú mǐ ná hu i, bónú vǐwungbo ɔ́ ná húzú mǐtɔn.’ "
So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. “What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? ,"Bɔ yě dɔn ɛ tɔ́n sín vǐwungbo ɔ́ mɛ, bó hu i.” Jezu wá kanbyɔ́ ɖɔ: “Nɛ̌ nya énɛ́ ɔ́ ka ná wa vǐwunzɔ́watɔ́ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ sín nǔ gbɔn?” "
"He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.” When the people heard this, they said, “May this never be!” ","“É ná wá, bó ná hu vǐwunzɔ́watɔ́ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ, lobo ná sɔ́ vǐwungbo ɔ́ dó alɔ mɛ nú mɛ ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ.” Ée mɛ lɛ́ɛ se mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě ɖɔ: “Mawu ní ma lɔn ó.” "
"Jesus looked directly at them and asked, “Then what is the meaning of that which is written: “ ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone ’? ","Lo ɔ́, Jezu kpɔ́n yě bó ɖɔ: “Xó élɔ́ e è wlǎn dó Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, ani ɖɔ wɛ é ka ɖe: ‘Awǐnnya e xɔmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ma sɔ́ dó mɔ nǔɖéwanú ǎ, bó xo nyi kɛ́n ɔ́, wá húzú awǐnnya e ɖo tají é.’ "
"Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed.” ","Mɛɖěbǔ jɛ awǐnnya énɛ́ jí ɔ́, mɛ ɔ́ ná gba hánnyá; mɛ e jí awǐnnya ɔ́ ka ná jɛ ɔ́, é ná li i kpɔ́ɖɔ́kpɔ́ɖɔ́.” "
"The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people. ","Gan énɛ́ mɛ ɖokpó ɔ́, vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpán ɖo lě e yě ná wa gbɔn, bɔ alɔ ná jɛ Jezu wú ɔ́ ba wɛ, ɖó yě tunwun ɖɔ émí nyi mǎ wɛ é ɖe; lo ɔ́, yě ɖo xɛsi ɖi nú togun ɔ́ wɛ.

"Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to be honest. They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor. ","Yě ká wá jɛ Jezu cɔ́ jí, bó ɖó mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ n'i, nú yě ná yi ba gbe ɖo nu tɔn.

"So the spies questioned him: “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.

Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?” ,"Đo sɛ́n mǐtɔn mɛ ɔ́, è hɛn ɔ́, è nǎ sú takwɛ́ Dadá Hlɔ̌ma tɔn tɔn a, abǐ è nǎ gbɔ súsú?” "
"He saw through their duplicity and said to them, ","Jezu ka mɔ nǔ jɛ ayi e ɖó wɛ yě ɖe ɔ́ wú, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: "
“Show me a denarius. Whose portrait and inscription are on it?” ,"“Mi xlɛ́ gankwɛ́ Hlɔ̌manu lɛ́ɛ tɔn ɖokpó mì ma kpɔ́n;” bɔ yě xlɛ́ ɛ, bɔ é kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌ ɖíe è ɖe ɖ'é jí e? Mɛ̌ sín nyǐkɔ ɖíe ɖ'é jí e?” Bɔ yě yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Dadá Hlɔ̌ma tɔn tɔn wɛ.” "
"“Caesar's,” they replied. He said to them, “Then give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's.” ","Bɔ Jezu ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi bó sɔ́ nǔ e nyí Dadá Hlɔ̌ma tɔn tɔn ɔ́ jó nú Dadá Hlɔ̌ma tɔn, bó sɔ́ nǔ e nyí Mawu tɔn ɔ́ jó nú Mawu.” "
"They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer, they became silent. ","Yě ká kpé wú, bó wlí i ɖo xógbe tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖě mɛ ɖo mɛ lɛ́ɛ nukɔn ǎ. Xósin e é ná yě ɔ́ kpácá yě, bɔ yě gbɔ bó xwɛ. "
"Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question. ",Sinsɛngbɛ́ e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Saduseɛn lɛ́ɛ ɖě wǎ Jezu gɔ́n. (Yě wɛ nɔ́ ɖɔ mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ kún ná fɔ́n ó). Yě kanbyɔ́ Jezu ɖɔ: 
"“Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother. ","“Mɛ̌si, sɛ́n e Mɔyízi wlán ɖ'ayǐ nú mǐ ɔ́ ɖíe: ‘Ényí mɛɖé ɖó nɔví súnnu, bó da asi, lobo ma ka ji vǐ ǎ, bó kú jó asi ɔ́ dó ɔ́, nɔví tɔn ɔ́ ná sɔ́ asi ɔ́ da, bó ji vǐ ɖo xo tɔn mɛ, bó ná sixú ɖó donu nú nɔví tɔn e kú é.’ "
Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless. ,"Nɔví nɔví tɛ́nwe ɖé lɛ́ɛ ka tíin. Mɛ nukɔntɔn ɔ́ da asi; é ka ji vǐ ǎ, bó kú jó asi ɔ́ dó, "
The second ,"bɔ mɛ wegɔ́ ɔ́ sɔ́ asúkúsi ɔ́ da; élɔ́ ka ji vǐ ǎ, bó kú jó nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ dó; "
"and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children. ","mɛ atɔngɔ́ ɔ́ lɔ wá sɔ́ asúkúsi ɔ́ da; élɔ́ ka ji vǐ ǎ, bó kú jó nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ dó. Mɔ̌ wɛ é nyí gbɔn nú nɔví nɔví tɛ́nwe énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ, bɔ yě bǐ kú ma ɖó vǐ donu; gǔdo gúdo ɔ́, nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ lɔ wá kú.” "
"Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?” ","Hwenu e mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ ná wá fɔ́n ɔ́, mɛ̌ sín asi wɛ nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ ka ná nyí ɖo yě mɛ tɛ́nwe lɛ́ɛ mɛ? Đó éɖíe ko nyí yě bǐ sín asi kpɔ́n e. "
"Jesus replied, “The people of this age marry and are given in marriage. ","Jezu yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Súnnu kpódó nyɔ̌nu kpó e ɖo ayǐkúngban jí din lɛ́ɛ wɛ nɔ da asi, bó nɔ da asú. "
"But those who are considered worthy of taking part in that age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, ","Lo ɔ́, mɛ e Mawu mɔ ɖɔ fínfɔ́n sín kú jɛ xá, bɔ yě ná nɔ gbɛ e jǎwe ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ sɔ́ na da asi ǎ, yě ká sɔ́ na da asú ǎ. "
"and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God's children, since they are children of the resurrection. ","Mɔ̌ jɛ́n yě ma sɔ́ sixú kú ǎ é nɛ́; ɖó yě ná cí wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔhun, bó ná nyí Mawu ví, ɖó yě fɔ́n sín mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ mɛ. "
"But in the account of the bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ ","Mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ ná fɔ́n sín kú xó ɔ́ ɖɔ wɛ Mɔyízi ɖe ɖo sɛ́nwéma e ɖɔ xó dó zungodwe e ɖo zo ji wɛ ɔ́ wú ɔ́ mɛ; hwenu e é ylɔ́ Aklúnɔ ɖɔ Mawu Ablaxámu tɔn, Mawu Izáki tɔn, Mawu Jakɔ́bu tɔn ɔ́, mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ ná fɔ́n xó ɔ́ ɖɔ wɛ é ɖe.

"He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive.” ","Hǔn, Mawu ɔ́, é nyí Mawu mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ tɔn ǎ; Mawu mɛ e ɖo gbɛ lɛ́ɛ tɔn wɛ é nyí; ɖó, ɖo Mawu nukɔn ɔ́, yě bǐ wɛ ɖo gbɛ.” "
"Some of the teachers of the law responded, “Well said, teacher!” ","Sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ ɖé lɛ́ɛ ka yí xó, bó ɖɔ nú Jezu ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌si, a ɖɔ xó ganjí.” "
And no one dared to ask him any more questions. ,"Bɔ yě sɔ́ glá, bó kan nǔ ɖěbǔ byɔ́ Jezu ǎ. "
"Then Jesus said to them, “How is it that they say the Christ is the Son of David? ","Jezu ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Nɛ̌ è ka sixú ɖɔ Klísu ɔ́, Davídi ví wɛ é nyí gbɔn? "
David himself declares in the Book of Psalms: “ ‘The Lord said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand ,"Đó Davídi ɖésú wɛ ɖɔ ɖo Ɖɛhanwéma tɔn mɛ ɖɔ: ‘Aklúnɔ ɖɔ nú Aklúnɔ ce ɖɔ: Jǐnjɔ́n ɖisí ce xwé, "

David calls him ‘Lord.’ How then can he be his son?” ,Davídi nɛ́ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Aklúnɔ nɛ́
"While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples, ","Togun ɔ́ bǐ ɖo tó ɖó Jezu wɛ, bɔ é ɖɔ nú ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: "
“Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. ,"“Mi cɔ́ miɖée dó sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ wú, ɖó nǔ e nɔ víví nú yě lɛ́ɛ wɛ nyí ɖɔ: yě ní ɖo awu gaga mɛ, bó ɖo sa ɖi wɛ; è nǐ nɔ́ dó gbe yě ɖo tokplétɛn lɛ́ɛ; yě nɔ́ ba ná jínjɔ́n zinkpo nukúnɖéjí lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɖo kplɔ́ngbasá lɛ́ɛ, bó nɔ́ ba ná jínjɔ́n tɛn nukɔn nukɔntɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɖo jǒnɔgbé.” "
"They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely.”As he looked up, Jesus saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple treasury. ","Yě nɔ klá jɛ nǔ e nyí asúkúsi lɛ́ɛ tɔn é bǐ nu, bó ka nɔ́ ɖo ɖɛ gaga xo wɛ, bó ná dó ɖe xlɛ́ gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ mɛ ɖagbe wɛ émí nyí.

"“I tell you the truth,” he said, “this poor widow has put in more than all the others. ","Ée Jezu mɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, é ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Má ɖɔ nǔgbó nú mi; akwɛ́ e asúkúsi wamamɔnɔ élɔ́ ná ɔ́, é hú mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ bǐ tɔn. "
All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth,Fon
"Some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated to God. But Jesus said, ","Ée mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖo awǐnnya ɖagbe ɖagbe lɛ́ɛ xó ɖɔ wɛ, bó ɖo nǔ e mɛ lɛ́ɛ ná Mawu, bɔ è dó ɖó acɔ́ nú sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́ xó ɖɔ wɛ ɔ́, Jezu ɖɔ: "
"“As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one of them will be thrown down.” ","“Nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ e mɔ wɛ mi ɖe din ɔ́, hwe ɖé nu ná wá su, bɔ awǐnnya lɛ́ɛ ɖě sɔ́ ná kpo ɖo ɖě jí ǎ; bǐ wɛ è nǎ mu.” "
"“Teacher,” they asked, “when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?” ","Yě kanbyɔ́ Jezu ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌si, hwetɛ́nu wɛ nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ká ná wá jɛ? Wuntun tɛ́ ká ná ɖe xlɛ́ mǐ ɖɔ nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ko ɖo nǎ jɛ wɛ?” "
"He replied: “Watch out that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am he,’ and, ‘The time is near.’ Do not follow them. ","Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi hɛn ayi nú mɛɖé má wá flú mi ó.

"When you hear of wars and revolutions, do not be frightened.

This will result in your being witnesses to them. ,"Nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ná jɛ dó mi jí, bɔ mi ná ɖó d'é wú, bó ná ɖe kúnnu nú mì. "
But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves. ,"Mi ka tunwun ɖɔ xó e mi ná yi ɖɔ dó hwlɛ́n miɖée ɔ́, mi kún ná ba ɖ'ayǐ ó. "
For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict. ,"Đó un ná sɔ́ xó e mi ná ɖɔ é kpódó nǔnywɛ́ e mi ná zán é kpán bǐ dó ayi mɛ nú mi, bɔ kɛntɔ́ mitɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖěbǔ ná sixú mɔ xó ɖé, bó dó gba mitɔn ɔ́ ná ǎ. "

But not a hair of your head will perish. ,"Lo ɔ́, ɖa mitɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó ná hwe ǎ. "
By standing firm you will gain life. ,"Ényí mi ka dɛ ɖo ya énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ nu ɔ́, Mawu ná hwlɛ́n mi gán.” "
"“When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near. ","“Hwenu e mi ka ná wá mɔ kɛntɔ́ lɛ́ɛ nyi ahwan, bó ján Jeluzalɛ́mu toxo ɔ́, mi nywɛ́ ɖɔ hwenu e è nǎ gba dó ɔ́ kó sɛ yá. "
"Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country not enter the city.

For this is the time of punishment in fulfillment of all that has been written. ,"Đó hlɔnbiba sín azǎn wɛ azǎn énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ná nyí, bɔ nǔ e è ko wlán ɖ'ayǐ é bǐ ná jɛ. "
How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!

They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations.

"Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.” ","Jezu ka sɛ́ Piyɛ́ɛ kpódó Jǎan kpó dó, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi yi bló tɛnmɛ ɖó, bó ɖa nǔɖuɖu e mǐ nǎ dó ɖu Dǐndínwáyixwe ɔ́ ná é.” "
“Where do you want us to prepare for it?” they asked. ,Yě ká kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Fítɛ́ a jlǒ ɖɔ mǐ ní yi sɔ́ xwe ɔ́ sín nǔ ɖe?” 
"He replied, “As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters, ","É ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Éɖíe: mi ɖo toxo ɔ́ mɛ ná byɔ́ wɛ ɔ́, mi ná mɔ nya ɖé, bɔ é ná hɛn sin dó tɔyizɛ́n mɛ wá xweyǐgbe; mi xwedó e káká yi xwé e gbe é ná byɔ́ é, "
"and say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’ ",bó ɖɔ nú xwétɔ́ ɔ́ ɖɔ: ‘Mɛ̌si ɖɔ mǐ ní wá kan xɔ e mɛ émí kpódó ahwanvú émítɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó ná ɖu Dǐndínwáyixwe ɔ́ ɖe ɔ́ byɔ́ we.’ 
"He will show you a large upper room, all furnished. Make preparations there.” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, xwétɔ́ ɔ́ ná xlɛ́ xɔ ɖaxó ɖé mi ɖo síngbó jí, bɔ nǔ bǐ ko sɔgbe ɖ'é mɛ; fínɛ́ wɛ mi ná sɔ́ xwe ɔ́ sín nǔ ɖ'ayǐ ɖe.” "
They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover. ,"Ahwanvú tɔn we lɛ́ɛ ka yi, bó mɔ nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ lě e Jezu ɖɔ gbɔn nú yě ɔ́, bɔ yě ɖa xwe ɔ́ sín nǔɖuɖu ɖo fínɛ́. "
"When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table. ","Ée hwe ɔ́ nu su é ɔ́, Jezu kpódó mɛsɛ́dó tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpán ja nǔ ɖu gbé, "
"And he said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. ","bɔ Jezu ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Un ko jló tlala ɖɔ ma ɖu Dǐndínwáyixwe sín nǔɖuɖu élɔ́ xá mi, cóbó ná jɛ ya ji jí; "
"For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.” ","ɖó ma ɖɔ nú mi: un sɔ́ ɖo ɖě ná ɖu wɛ gbeɖé, káká yi jɛ hwenu e Mawu ná ɖe nǔ e xwe ɔ́ nyí ɔ́ xlɛ́, ɖo axɔ́súɖuɖu tɔn mɛ dó é ǎ.” "
"After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, “Take this and divide it among you. ","É ká wá sɔ́ kɔ́fu ɖokpó, bɔ vɛ̌ɛn ɖ'é mɛ, bɔ é dó kú nú Mawu, bó ɖɔ: “Mi yí, bó má nu, "
For I tell you I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.” ,"ɖó má ɖɔ nú mi, bɛ́ sín din ɔ́, vɛ̌ɛn ɖě sɔ́ ɖo nu ce ná jɛ wɛ káká yi jɛ hwenu e axɔ́súɖuɖu Mawu tɔn ná wá dó é ǎ.” "
"And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.” ","Ée Jezu ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, é sɔ́ wɔ̌xúxú, bó dó kú nú Mawu, bó kán, bó ná yě bó ɖɔ: “Élɔ́ ɔ́, agbaza ce wɛ; [agbaza ce e un sɔ́ jó dó mi ta mɛ ɔ́ wɛ; mi nɔ bló lě, dó flín mì ná.” "
"In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. ","Ée yě ɖu nǔ gúdo ɔ́, é sɔ́ vɛ̌ɛn kɔ́fu ɔ́ lɔmɔ̌ nú yě, bó ɖɔ: “Vɛ̌ɛn élɔ́ ɔ́, hun ce wɛ; hun ce e Mawu dó sɔ́ akɔjijɛ yɔ̌yɔ́ ɔ́ sín afɔ ɖó te ná ɔ́ wɛ; é wɛ kɔn nyi ayǐ dó ta mitɔn mɛ.] "
But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table. ,“Mɛ e ka ɖo nǎ sɔ́ mì jó wɛ é ɖíe ɖo nǔ ɖu xá mì wɛ e. 
"The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed, but woe to that man who betrays him.” ","Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ ɖó ná kú, lě e Mawu kó ɖɔ gbɔn é, amɔ̌ mɛ e ná sɔ́ ɛ jó ɔ́, heelú i.” "
They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this. ,Yě ká jɛ kinkanbyɔ́ yěɖée jí ɖɔ mɛ̌ ka ɖo nǔ mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn ná dó sin wɛ ɖo émí mɛ a jí. 
Also a dispute arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest. ,"Yě jɛ nǔ dɔn jí kpó adǎn kpó ɖo yěɖée tɛ́ntin, ɖɔ mɛ̌ ká ɖó ná nyí nǔɖaxó ɖo émí mɛ a jí. "
"Jesus said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors. ","Jezu ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Togun e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ sín axɔ́sú lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ kpa acɛ gannaganna nú yě, bɔ mɛ e nyí gǎn lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ ba ɖɔ è nǐ ylɔ́ émí ɖɔ ‘Đagbewatɔ́.’ "
"But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves. ","Lo ɔ́, nǔ ná nyí mɔ̌ ɖo midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ mɛ ǎ; é nyɔ́ wa ɔ́, mɛ e nyí nǔɖaxó ɖo mi mɛ é ní cí yɔkpɔ́vú ɖɔhun; mɛ e ka nyí gǎn é ní cí mɛsɛntɔ́ ɖɔhun. "
"For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves. ","Đo mɛ e ɖo nǔ ɖu wɛ é kpódó mɛ e ɖo mɛ sɛn wɛ ɔ́ kpán mɛ ɔ́, mɛ̌ wɛ hú gǎn mɛ ɖě? Mɛ e ɖo nǔ ɖu wɛ é wɛ ǎ cé? É ɖo mɔ̌ có, nyɛ ka ɖo mi mɛ mɛsɛntɔ́ ɖɔhun. "
You are those who have stood by me in my trials. ,"“Midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mi wɛ nɔ gúdo ce hwebǐnu, ɖo adǎngbomɛ ce lɛ́ɛ mɛ. "
"And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me, ","Énɛ́ wú ɔ́, nyɛ ɔ́, un sɔ́ axɔ́súɖuto ɔ́ ɖó te nú mi, lě e Tɔ́ ce sɔ́ ɖó te nú nyɛ gbɔn é, "
"so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. ","bónú mi na ɖu nǔ, bó nu sin xá mì, ɖo axɔ́súɖuto ce mɛ, lobo na jínjɔ́n axɔ́súzinkpo jí, bó na ɖɔ hwɛ xá Izlayɛ́li sín akɔta wěwe lɛ́ɛ.” "
"“Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift you as wheat. ","“Aklúnɔ ɖɔ: Sinmɔ́ɔ! Sinmɔ́ɔ! Đǒtó; Satáan byɔ́ mi, bó na fún mi lě e è nɔ fún jinukún gbɔn é. "
"But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.” ","Lo ɔ́, un sa vo nú Mawu ɖó ta towe mɛ, bónú nǔɖiɖi má wá hwe dó we ó. Hwenu e a ka ná lɛ́ kɔ wá gɔ̌n ce ɔ́, dǒ wǔsyɛ́n lanmɛ nú nɔví towe lɛ́ɛ.” "
"But he replied, “Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.” ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ! Un ɖo gbesisɔ mɛ, bó ná xwedó we yi ganxó, bó ná xwedó we yi kú.” "
"Jesus answered, “I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.” ",Jezu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Má ɖɔ nú we Piyɛ́ɛ! Kokló ná kó kɔ́ así égbé cóbɔ a nǎ kó gbɛ́ azɔn atɔn ɖɔ émí kún tunwun mì ó ǎ.” 
"Then Jesus asked them, “When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?” “Nothing,” they answered. ","Jezu ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Hwenu e un sɛ́ mi dó, bɔ mi ma hɛn akwɛ́kpo ǎ, bó ma ka hɛn nǔbyɔ́ɖutɔ́glo ǎ, lobo ma ka hɛn afɔkpa ǎ ɔ́, mi jɛ nǔɖé dó wɛ a?” Bɔ yě yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Éeǒ, mǐ jɛ nǔ ɖěbǔ do ǎ.” "
"He said to them, “But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one. ","É ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Amɔ̌, din ɔ́, mɛɖé ɖó akwɛ́kpo hǔn, ní sɔ́ hɛn; mɛɖé ɖó nǔbyɔ́ɖutɔ́glo hǔn, ní sɔ́ hɛn; mɛ e ma ka ɖó hwǐ ǎ é ɔ́, ní sa awu tɔn dó xɔ ná. "
"It is written: ‘And he was numbered with the transgressors’; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment.” ",Đó má ɖɔ nú mi: nǔ élɔ́ e è wlǎn ɔ́ ɖó ná jɛ dó jǐ ce. ‘È lɛ̌n ɛ dó dǎkaxotɔ́ lɛ́ɛ sín ahwan mɛ.’ Nǔ e è wlǎn dó wǔ ce lɛ́ɛ ɖó ná jɛ.” 
"The disciples said, “See, Lord, here are two swords.” “That is enough,” he replied. ","Yě ká ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ, hwǐ we ɖíe ɖo fí e.” É ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “É ko kpé.” "
"Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him. ","Jezu tɔ́n, bó ɖidó olívutín só ɔ́ ta, lě e é kó nɔ́ bló gbɔn ɖ'ayǐ é, bɔ ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ xwedó e. "
"On reaching the place, he said to them, “Pray that you will not fall into temptation.” ","Ée é jɛ fínɛ́ ɔ́, é ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi xo ɖɛ, bó ma wá jɛ tɛ́nkpɔ́n ɖaxó mɛ ó.” "
"He withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed, ","Ée é ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, é sɛ yi zɔ nú yě, nǎ yi mɛ̌tlukpo gban mɔ̌, bó jɛ kpo, bó jɛ ɖɛ xo jí "
"“Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.” ","ɖɔ: “Daá! Ényí a jlǒ hǔn, sɛ wǔvɛ́ kɔ́fu élɔ́ dó zɔ nú mì; amɔ̌, ní má nyí jlǒ ce ó, lo ɔ́, ní nyí lě e é jló hwɛ gbɔn é.” [ "
An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. ,"Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn ɖokpó gosín jǐxwé wá tɔ́n dó jǐ tɔn, bó ná ɛ akɔ́nkpinkpan. "
"And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground. ","Jezu ka ɖo kúsukpɔ xo wɛ, bó lɛ́ ɖo ɖɛ xo wɛ syɛ́nsyɛ́n, bɔ dɛ̌n e jɛ wɛ é ɖe ɔ́ cí hun ɖɔhun, bó nɔ kun kɔn nyi ayǐ.] "
"When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow. ","Ée é xo ɖɛ gúdo ɔ́, é sí te, bó yi ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ gɔ́n, bó mɔ yě ɖo amlɔ mɛ wǔbláwúblá, "
“Why are you sleeping?” he asked them. “Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.” ,"bó ɖɔ: “Étɛ́! Amlɔ dɔ́ wɛ mi ɖe a? Mi sí te bó xo ɖɛ, bó má wá jɛ tɛ́nkpɔ́n ɖaxó mɛ ó.” "
"While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him, ","Mɔ̌ ɖɔ wɛ Jezu ɖe kɛ́ɖɛ́, bɔ mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ nyi ahwan wá xwetɔ́n, bɔ mɛ e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Judási ɖo ahwanvú tɔn wěwe lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɔ́ zɔn yě nu.

"but Jesus asked him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?” ","bɔ Jezu ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Judási, é má nyí si wɛ a kí nú Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ bó dó jó e a?” "
"When Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?” ","Ée mɛ e ɖo Jezu kpá lɛ́ɛ mɔ nǔ e ɖo nǎ jɛ wɛ é ɔ́, yě kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ, mǐ ní jɛ hwǐ xú mɛ jí a?” "
"And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. ","Mɛ ɖokpó ka ɖo yě mɛ, bó xú hwǐ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó ɔ́ sín mɛsɛntɔ́, bó kpa tó tɔn ɖisíxwé tɔn ɔ́. "
"But Jesus answered, “No more of this!” And he touched the man's ear and healed him. ","Jezu ka ɖɔ: “Mi gbɔ; ní nɔ mɔ̌!” É ka ɖó alɔ tó ɔ́ wú, bɔ tó jɛ tó tɛnmɛ. "
"Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, “Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs? ","Jezu ka ɖɔ nú vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó sinsɛnxɔcɔ́tɔ́ sín gǎn lɛ́ɛ kpó, kpódó tomɛxó e wá gbě tɔn mɛ lɛ́ɛ kpán ɖɔ: “Ajotɔ́ axánsúnxó wɛ un ka nyí, bɔ mi hɛn hwǐ kpódó kpo kpó jɛ gbě ce mɛ a? "
"Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour–when darkness reigns.” ","Ayǐhɔ́ngbe ayǐhɔ́ngbe wɛ nyɛ kpódó mi kpán nɔ́ ɖo sinsɛnxɔ mɛ, bɔ mi ka wlí mì ǎ; lo ɔ́, mi kpódó ablu mɛ hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n lɛ́ɛ kpó sín gan wɛ xo din.” "
"Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance. ","Ée yě wlí Jezu ɔ́, yě dɔn ɛ yi vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó ɔ́ xwé. Piyɛ́ɛ jɛ gǔdo yětɔn, é ka lɔn bó sɛkpɔ́ yě ǎ. "
"But when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them. ","Mɛ ɖé lɛ́ɛ ka bɔ myɔ ɖo kɔ́xo ɔ́ ta, bó jínjɔ́n ayǐ lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó, bɔ Piyɛ́ɛ wá yi jínjɔ́n yě mɛ. "
"A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, “This man was with him.” ","Nyɔ̌nu mɛsɛntɔ́ ɖokpó mɔ ɛ ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n ɖo myɔ ɔ́ kɔn; é kpɔ́n ɛ tlítlí, bó ɖɔ: “Mɛ élɔ́ lɔmɔ̌ nɔ zɔn xá ɛ!” "
"But he denied it. “Woman, I don't know him,” he said. ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka gbɛ́ bó ɖɔ: “Nyɔ̌nu, un tunwun i ǎ.” "
"A little later someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” “Man, I am not!” Peter replied. ","É nɔ zaan, bɔ mɛ ɖěvo lɛ́ wá mɔ ɛ, bó ɖɔ: “Hwi lɔmɔ̌ ɖo mɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ!” Piyɛ́ɛ ka gbɛ́, bó ɖɔ: “Éeǒ, un ɖo yě mɛ ɖě ǎ!” "
"About an hour later another asserted, “Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean.” ","É ná yi gan xixo ɖokpó mɔ̌, bɔ mɛ ɖěvo lɛ́ wá, bó tɛ ɖɛ̌ jí syɛ́nsyɛ́n ɖɔ: “Nya élɔ́ nɔ́ zɔn xá ɛ dandan, ɖó Galilée nu wɛ!” "
"Peter replied, “Man, I don't know what you're talking about!” Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed. ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka ɖɔ: “Nya ce, un mɔ nǔ jɛ nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ a ɖe ɔ́ mɛ ǎ.” Xó énɛ́ ɖɔ wɛ é ɖe kɛ́ɖɛ́ bɔ kokló kɔ́ así. "
"The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.” ","Aklúnɔ ká lílɛ́, bó kpɔ́n Piyɛ́ɛ, bɔ Piyɛ́ɛ flín xó e Aklúnɔ kó ɖɔ n'i ɖ'ayǐ é; é wɛ nyí ɖɔ: “Cóbónú kokló ná kɔ́ así égbé ɔ́, a nǎ kó gbɛ́ azɔn atɔn ɖɔ émí kún tunwun mì ó.” "
And he went outside and wept bitterly. ,"Bɔ é tɔ́n jɛ hɔnto, bó ya avǐ kpódó vǐvɛ́ kpó. "
The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him. ,"Mɛ e è sɔ́ ɖó Jezu kɔn, bɔ yě ɖo cícɔ́ ɛ wɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖo kiko e wɛ, bó ɖo xixo e wɛ. "
"They blindfolded him and demanded, “Prophesy! Who hit you?” ","Yě sɔ́ avɔ dó blá nukún mɛ n'i, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Đɔ mɛ e dó nǔ we din ɔ́ nú mǐ.” "
And they said many other insulting things to him. ,Yě ɖɔ nǔyá gěgé ɖěvo n'i. 
"At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them. ","Ayǐ ká wá hɔ́n, bɔ tomɛxó lɛ́ɛ kpódó vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpó, kpódó sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpán wá kplé, bó dɔn Jezu yi hwɛɖɔxɔsá yětɔn ɖaxó ɔ́, "
"“If you are the Christ, ” they said, “tell us.” Jesus answered, “If I tell you, you will not believe me, ","bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Ényí hwi wɛ nyí Klísu ɔ́ hǔn, ɖɔ nú mǐ.” Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Un ɖɔ nú mi ɔ́, mi ná ɖi ǎ; "
"and if I asked you, you would not answer. ","un ka kan nǔ byɔ́ mi ɔ́, mi ná yí gbe nú mì ǎ. "
"But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.” ","Amɔ̌, sín din ɔ́, nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ ná jínjɔ́n Mawu Nǔbǐwúkpétɔ́ ɔ́ sín ɖisíxwé.” "
"They all asked, “Are you then the Son of God?” He replied, “You are right in saying I am.” ",Yě bǐ ka ɖɔ: “Hǔn Mawu ví wɛ nú we nɛ́ hǔn?” É ká yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “É jɛ́n nɛ́ mi ɖɔ nɛ́.” 
"Then they said, “Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips.”Then the whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate. ","Ée Jezu ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě yí xó, bó ɖɔ: “Kúnnuɖetɔ́ tɛ́ ba wɛ mǐ ká sɔ́ kpo ɖe? É ɖésú nɛ́ kó sɔ́ nu tɔn dó ɖɔ ná din bɔ mǐ se nɛ́.”Agun ɔ́ bǐ sí te, bó kplá Jezu hɛn yi Pilátu nukɔn. "
"And they began to accuse him, saying, “We have found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Christ, a king.” ","Đo fínɛ́ ɔ́, yě jɛ hwɛ xa dó kɔ n'i jí, bó nɔ́ ɖɔ: “Mǐ mɔ nya élɔ́ bɔ é nɔ́ ɖo to ɔ́ dɔn bú wɛ.

"So Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?” “Yes, it is as you say,” Jesus replied. ",Pilátu ka kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Hwi wɛ nyí Jwifu lɛ́ɛ sín axɔ́sú ɔ́ a?” Jezu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Hwi wɛ ɖɔ!” 
"Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.” ",Pilátu ka wá ɖɔ nú vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó agun ɔ́ kpán ɖɔ: “Un mɔ hwɛ ɖě ɖo kɔ nú nya élɔ́ ǎ.” 
"But they insisted, “He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here.” ","Yědɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ka lɛ́ tɛ ɖɛ̌ jí, bó nɔ́ ɖɔ: “Nǔ e kplɔ́n mɛ wɛ é ɖe ɔ́ ɖo Judée to ɔ́ bǐ dán wɛ; Galilée yíkúngban jí wɛ é bɛ́ sín, káká wá jɛ fí.” "
"On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean. ","Ée Pilátu se Galilée xó ɔ́, é kanbyɔ́ ɖɔ Galiléenu wɛ nya ɔ́ nyí a jí. "
"When he learned that Jesus was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time. ","Ée é mɔ nǔ jɛ wú ɖɔ Elódu sín acɛ mɛ wɛ Jezu ɖe ɔ́, é nyi i sɛ́ dó Elódu, ɖó é lɔmɔ̌ ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu hwenɛ́nu. "
"When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform some miracle. ","Ée Elódu mɔ Jezu ɔ́, xomɛ hun i tlala; ɖó é kó ɖo biba ná mɔ ɛ wɛ ɔ́, é kó lín, ɖó nǔ e é nɔ́ se dó wǔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ wú, bó ɖo nukún ɖó wɛ ɖɔ é ná jlɛ́ nǔ bɔ émí ná kpɔ́n. "
"He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer. ","É kan nǔ gěgé byɔ́ ɛ; lo ɔ́, Jezu kɛ nu d'é mɛ n'i ǎ. "
"The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently accusing him. ","Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ, kpódó sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpán ká ɖo fínɛ́, bó ɖo hwɛ xa dó kɔ n'i wɛ syɛ́nsyɛ́n. "
"Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate. ","Elódu kpódó sɔ́ja tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpán ká wa wǎngbɛ́númɛ sín nǔ xá Jezu; yě ko e, lobo sɔ́ awu ɖagbe ɖagbe ɖé dó n'i, bó nyi i sɛ́ dó Pilátu gɔ́n. "
That day Herod and Pilate became friends–before this they had been enemies. ,"Gbe énɛ́ ɔ́ gbe wɛ Elódu kpódó Pilátu kpán gbɔ kɛn e yě ɖe ɖ'ayǐ é, bó húzú xɔ́ntɔn. "
"Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people, ","Pilátu ka ylɔ́ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó togán lɛ́ɛ kpó, kpódó togun ɔ́ kpán kplé, "
"and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him.

"Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death. ",Elódu lɔ ka mɔ nǔɖé ǎ
"Therefore, I will punish him and then release him.” ","Hǔn, un ná xo e, bó ná jó e dó.” [ "
"With one voice they cried out, “Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!” ","Yě bǐ ka jɛ xó sú jí ɖɔ: “Hu nya élɔ́, bó ɖe Balabási nyi te nú mǐ.” "
"(Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.) ","Balabási énɛ́ ɔ́, gǔ wɛ é fɔ́n dó gǎn lɛ́ɛ jí, lobo hu mɛ, bɔ è wlǐ i dó gan. "
"Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again. ",Pilátu ka jló ná ɖe Jezu nyi te
"But they kept shouting, “Crucify him! Crucify him!” ","Yě ká sú xó, bó ɖɔ: “Ká ɛ nyi aklúzu jí! Ká ɛ nyi aklúzu jí!” "
For the third time he spoke to them: “Why? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him.” ,"Pilátu ka lɛ́ ɖɔ nú yě azɔn atɔngɔ́ ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Nǔ nyanya tɛ́ é ká wa? Nyɛ mɔ hwɛ ɖě n'i ǎ. Hǔn, un ná xo e, bó ná jó e dó.” "
"But with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified, and their shouts prevailed. ","Lo ɔ́, yě ɖo xó sú wɛ syɛ́nsyɛ́n, bó ɖo tagba dó nú Pilátu wɛ ɖɔ è ní ká ɛ nyi aklúzu jí; xó e sú wɛ yě ɖe ɔ́ hú gǎn Pilátu, "
So Pilate decided to grant their demand. ,bɔ Pilátu gbo xó ɔ́ dó yětɔn jí. 
"He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will. ","Mɛ e è wlǐ dó gan ɖó hunnyahunnya dɔn dó to mɛ, kpódó mɛ huhu kpán wú ɔ́, è ɖe éyɛ́ nyi te, lě e yě byɔ́ gbɔn é, lobo ka jó Jezu nú yě, nú yě ná sɔ́ ɛ dó wa nǔ e jló yě ɔ́ ná. "
"As they led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus. ","Hwenu e è kplá Jezu xweyǐgbe ɔ́, nya ɖé tíin, bó lɛ́ kɔ sín gleta; è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Sinmɔ́ɔ; Silenɛ́ɛnu wɛ; yě wlí i, bó ɖíɖá ɛ aklúzu ɔ́, bónú é ná hɛn jɛ Jezu gúdo. "
"A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him. ","Mɛ lɛ́ɛ ká nyi ahwan xwedó Jezu, bɔ nyɔ̌nu lɛ́ɛ ɖo avǐ ya wɛ, bó ɖo alě ná wɛ. "
"Jesus turned and said to them, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children. ","Jezu ka lílɛ́ kpan nukɔn yě, bó ɖɔ: “Jeluzalɛ́munu nyɔ̌nu e mi, mi ma ya avǐ nú nyɛ ó; lo ɔ́, mi ya avǐ nú miɖée, bó ya avǐ nú vǐ mitɔn lɛ́ɛ. "
"For the time will come when you will say, ‘Blessed are the barren women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!’ ","Đó ayǐ ɖé lɛ́ɛ ná wá hɔ́n, bɔ è nǎ ɖɔ: ‘Nǔ nyɔ́ nú wɛnsinɔ lɛ́ɛ, bó nyɔ́ nú mɛ e ma ji vǐ kpɔ́n gbeɖé ǎ lɛ́ɛ, bó nyɔ́ nú mɛ e ma ná anɔ̌ vǐ kpɔ́n gbeɖé ǎ é.’ "
"Then “ ‘they will say to the mountains, “Fall on us!” and to the hills, “Cover us!” ’ ","Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, è nǎ jɛ ɖiɖɔ nú só ɖaxó ɖaxó lɛ́ɛ jí ɖɔ: ‘Mi mu kɔn nyi mǐ jǐ!’ Bó ná ɖɔ nú só kpɛví kpɛví lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: ‘Mi cyɔ́n mǐ.’ "
"For if men do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?” ","Đó ényí è ɖo atín mǔ sín nǔ wa gbɔn mɔ̌ wɛ ɔ́, nɛ̌ wɛ atín xúxú tɔn ka ná nyí gbɔn?” "
"Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed. ","Yě kplá dǎnúwatɔ́ we dó jǐ tɔn, bó ná yi hu yě kpó é kpó. "
"When they came to the place called the Skull, there they crucified him, along with the criminals–one on his right, the other on his left. ","Ée yě wá yi jɛ tɛn e mɛ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ “takágo” ɔ́, yě ká Jezu nyi aklúzu jí, bó ká dǎnúwatɔ́ we lɛ́ɛ: è ká mɛ ɖokpó ɖó ɖisí tɔn xwé, bó ká mɛ ɖokpó ɖó amyɔ tɔn xwé. "
"Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” And they divided up his clothes by casting lots. ","Jezu ka sa vo nú Mawu, bó ɖɔ: “Daá, yě tunwun nǔ e wa wɛ yě ɖe é ǎ; sɔ́ kɛ yě.” Yě ká nyi akɔ dó avɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ, bó sɔ́ yětɔn yětɔn. "
"The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said, “He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.” ","Togun ɔ́ ka cí fínɛ́, bó ɖo nǔ kpɔ́n wɛ.

The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar ,"Sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌ ɖo kiko e wɛ. Yě sɛ yi gɔ̌n tɔn, bó xwlé e vɛ̌ɛn sinvɛ́sinvɛ́, "

"There was a written notice above him, which read: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. ","È ka wlán xógbe élɔ́ dó ta tɔn nu ɖɔ: “Nya élɔ́ ɔ́, axɔ́sú Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn wɛ.” "
One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: “Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!” ,"Dǎnúwatɔ́ e è ka nyi aklúzu jí lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó ɖo zunzun i wɛ, bó nɔ́ ɖɔ: “É má nyí hwi wɛ nyí Klísu ǎ cé? Bo hwlɛ́n hwiɖée gán, bó hwlɛ́n mǐ lɔmɔ̌ gán bó!” "
"But the other criminal rebuked him. “Don't you fear God,” he said, “since you are under the same sentence? ","Lo ɔ́, mɛ ɖě ɔ́ gbɛ́ nǔ n'i, bó ɖɔ: “Hwɛ nɔ sí Mawu ǎ wɛ a? Hwi mɛ e kpó é kpó è ɖǒ kúhwɛ ɖokpó ɔ́ na é. "
"We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.” ","Mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, nǔ e mǐ wa ɔ́ sín axɔ́ sú wɛ mǐ ɖe, bɔ é sɔgbe; éyɛ́ má ká wa nǔ nyanya ɖěbǔ nɛ́!” "
"Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom. ” ","É ka lɛ́ ɖɔ: “Jezu, hwenu e a nǎ wá ɖu axɔ́sú ɖo gbɛ élɔ́ nu ɔ́, flín mì mɛ!” "
"Jesus answered him, “I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise.” ","Jezu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Má ɖɔ nǔgbó nú we: égbé din ɔ́, a nǎ ɖo Mawu gɔ̌n xá mì.” "
"It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour, ","Gan wěwe wɛ ɖo na xo wɛ kɛ́ɖɛ́, bɔ hwesivɔ́ cí, bɔ ablu cyɔ́n gbɛ ɔ́ bǐ, káká yi jɛ gan atɔn mɛ, bɔ avɔ ɖaxó e è dó gbo sinsɛnxɔ mɛ ná ɔ́ tlɛ́n ɖó we sín tɛ́ntin. "
"Jesus called out with a loud voice, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.” When he had said this, he breathed his last. ","Jezu ka sú xó kpó hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n kpó, bó ɖɔ: “Daá, un sɔ́ lǐndɔ̌n ce dó alɔ mɛ nú we.” Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, é bɔnu. "
"The centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, “Surely this was a righteous man.” ","Ée sɔ́ja kanwekogán ɔ́ mɔ nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ e jɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, é jɛ susu kpa nú Mawu jí ɖɔ: “Dandan mɛ ɔ́, nya élɔ́ ɔ́, xomɛvɔ́nɔ wɛ é nyí nǔgbó.” "
"When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away. ","Ée mɛ e nyi ahwan wá kpɔ́n nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ mɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě bǐ jɛ alɔ zin dó akɔ́n jí, dó ɖe xlɛ́ ɖɔ é kú wǔ nú émí, bó lɛ́ kɔ wá yi xwé. "
"But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things. ","Jezu sín xɔ́ntɔn lɛ́ɛ bǐ, kpódó nyɔ̌nu e xwedó e sín Galilée lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpan ka nɔ te ɖo zɔ, bó ɖo nǔ e ɖo jijɛ wɛ lɛ́ɛ kpɔ́n wɛ. "
"Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man, ","Nya nukúnɖéjí ɖokpó ka tíin, bó ɖo toxóɖɔgbɛ́ yětɔn mɛ, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Jozɛ́fu, bɔ é nyí gbɛtɔ́ ayijlɔ́jlɔ́nɔ, hwɛjijɔnɔ. "
who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea and he was waiting for the kingdom of God. ,É ɖo nǔ e mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ ɔ́ kpódó nǔ e yě wa ɔ́ kpó ɖěbǔ jí ǎ.

"Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body. ","É yi mɔ Pilátu, bó byɔ́ ɛ Jezu sín cyɔ. "
"Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid. ","É ɖe Jezu sín aklúzu ɔ́ jí, bó lɛ́ akwɛ́núvɔ dó e, lobo sɔ́ ɛ yi ɖi dó yɔdo e è kun dó sóxo mɛ é mɛ; yɔdo énɛ́ ɔ́, è ko ɖi mɛ ɖěbǔ d'é mɛ kpɔ́n ǎ. "
"It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin. ","Gbe énɛ́ gbe ɔ́, axɔ́súzán gbe wɛ bɔ gbɔjɛzán ɔ́ ko ɖo nǎ bɛ́ wɛ. "
The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it. ,"Nyɔ̌nu e kplá Jezu sín Galilée lɛ́ɛ xwedó Jozɛ́fu, bó kpɔ́n yɔdo ɔ́ mɛ, bó mɔ lě e è sɔ́ Jezu sín cyɔ ɖó é. "
"Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. ","Yě ká lɛ́ kɔ wá yi xwé, bó yi ba nǔsáwǔ wǎnɖagbenɔ kpódó célu kpó ɖó alɔ jí.

"They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, ","Yě mɔ ɖɔ awǐnnya e è dó sú yɔdo ɔ́ ná ɔ́, è ko blí sín i. "
"but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, yě byɔ́ yɔdo ɔ́ mɛ, yě ká mɔ Aklúnɔ Jezu sín cyɔ ǎ. "
"While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them. ","Yě sɔ́ tunwun nǔ e yě ná wa é ǎ, bó ɖo nukún dó gbɛmɛ kpɔ́n dó nǔ énɛ́ wú wɛ, bɔ nya we ɖé lɛ́ɛ wá tɔ́n ɖo akpá yětɔn, bɔ awu yětɔn nɔ́ kɔ́n. "
"In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead? ","Xɛsi jɛ nyɔ̌nu lɛ́ɛ jí, bɔ yě dǒ kɔ do; nya we lɛ́ɛ ká ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Étɛ́wú mi ka ɖo mɛ e ɖo gbɛ é ba wɛ ɖo mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ mɛ? "
"He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: ","É sɔ́ ɖo fí ǎ, è ko fɔ́n ɛ sín kú. Mi flín xó e é ɖɔ nú mi hwenu e é ɖo Galilée é; "
"‘The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.’ ” ","é ɖɔ: ‘È ɖǒ ná jó Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ nú hwɛhutɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, bɔ yě ná ká ɛ nyi aklúzu jí, bɔ Mawu ná fɔ́n ɛ sín kú azǎn tɔn atɔngɔ́ ɔ́ gbe.’ ” "
Then they remembered his words. ,Hwenɛ́nu wɛ yě wá flín xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ e Jezu ko ɖɔ nú yě ɖ'ayǐ é. 
"When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. ","Ée yě lɛ́ kɔ sín yɔdo ɔ́ kɔn ɔ́, yě wlí nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɖɔ nú mɛsɛ́dó wǒ-ɖokpó lɛ́ɛ, kpódó mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpán. "
"It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles. ","Nyɔ̌nu e ɖɔ nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ nú mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, yě ɖíe: Mali Magidalanu ɔ́, Jani kpódó Mali Jakinɔ ɔ́ kpán, kpódó nyɔ̌nu e kpó yě kpó zɔn lɛ́ɛ kpán. "
"But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense. ","Mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ ka mɔ xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ dó mɔ lɛ̌lo, bó ɖi nǔ nú nyɔ̌nu lɛ́ɛ sín xó ǎ; "
"Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened. ","có Piyɛ́ɛ ka sí te, bó kán wezun yi yɔdo ɔ́ kɔn. Ée é jɛ dɔ̌n ɔ́, é fɛ, bó kpɔ́n yɔdo ɔ́ mɛ, bó mɔ avɔ e è lɛ́ dó Jezu ɔ́ kɛ́ɖɛ́. Nǔ énɛ́ e jɛ ɔ́ búdo dó e, bɔ é lɛ́ kɔ wá yi xwé. "
"Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. ","Gbe nɛ́ gbe ɖokpó ɔ́, ahwanvú Jezu tɔn we ɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖo ali jí xwe gletoxo e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Emawúsi, bɔ é ɖo kilomɛ́tlu wǒ-ɖokpó mɔ̌ dó Jeluzalɛ́mu ɔ́ mɛ. "
They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. ,Yě ɖo xó ɖɔ dó nǔ énɛ́ e jɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ wú wɛ. 
"As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; ","Xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ wɛ yě ɖe, bó ɖo nǔ dɔn ɖ'é kɔn wɛ, bɔ Jezu ɖésú wá xwedó yě wú, bó jɛ ali zɔn xá yě jí. "
but they were kept from recognizing him. ,"Nǔɖé cyɔ́n nukún yětɔn jí, nú yě ma tunwun i ó. "
"He asked them, “What are you discussing together as you walk along?” They stood still, their faces downcast. ",É kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Xó tɛ́ ɖɔ dó ali wɛ mi ka ɖe mɔ̌?” Bɔ yě nɔ te wǔbláwúblá. 
"One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, “Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?” ",Mɛ e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Kleopasi ɖo yě mɛ ɔ́ yí gbe n'i ɖɔ jí: “Hǔn hwi ɖokpónɔ jɛ́n wɛ nyí jǒnɔ ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu bó dán nǔ e jɛ ɖo fínɛ́ azǎnví élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ mɛ é a?” 
"“What things?” he asked. “About Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. “He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. ","É ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Étɛ́ ka jɛ?” Yě yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Nǔ e kpé Jezu Nazalɛ́ti tɔn é wɛ.

"The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; ","Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó togán mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ kpán ka sɔ́ ɛ jó ɖɔ è nǐ ɖó kúhwɛ n'i, bó ká ɛ nyi aklúzu jí. "
"but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place. ","Mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ kó ɖo nukún ɖó wɛ ɖɔ é wɛ ná hwlɛ́n Izlayɛ́li togun ɔ́ gán. Lo ɔ́, nǔ cí mɔ̌ din ɔ́, azǎn tɔn atɔngɔ́ ɔ́ ɖíe. "
"In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning ","Nyɔ̌nu e ɖo ahwan mǐtɔn mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖěe wá dó adohu nú mǐ; yě fɔ́n zǎn yi yɔ ɔ́ kɔn, "
"but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. ","yě ká mɔ cyɔ tɔn ǎ, lobo wá ɖɔ nú mǐ; énɛ́ ɔ́ víví hwe, bɔ yě lɛ́ ɖɔ nú mǐ ɖɔ wɛnsagun ɖé lɛ́ɛ tɔ́n dó émí jí, lobo ɖɔ nú émí ɖɔ Jezu ɖo gbɛ. "
"Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.” ","Mɛ mǐtɔn ɖé lɛ́ɛ yi yɔ ɔ́ kɔn, bó mɔ nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ, lě e nyɔ̌nu lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ gbɔn é; lo ɔ́, yě mɔ Jezu ɔ́ ǎ.” "
"He said to them, “How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! ",Jezu ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Gbɛtɔ́ nǔnywɛ́hwedónánɔ lɛ́ɛ mi! Hwetɛ́nu wɛ mi ná wá ɖi nǔ nú nǔ e gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ kó ɖɔ ɔ́ bǐ dó? 
Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?” ,"Klísu ɔ́ má kó ɖó ná ji ya énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ hwɛ̌, cóbó ná dó sixú byɔ́ susu tɔn mɛ ǎ cé?” "
"And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself. ","É ka bɛ́ xó sín Mɔyízi jí, bó gbɔn gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ bǐ jí, bɔ nǔ e è wlǎn dó wǔtu tɔn ɖo Mawuxówéma mɛ ɔ́, é tín bǐ mɛ nú yě. "
"As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther. ","Ée yě ká sɛ yá gletoxo e mɛ yě xwe ɔ́, Jezu bló nǔ mɛ e ná dín yi nukɔn ɖɔhun; "
"But they urged him strongly, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.” So he went in to stay with them. ","lo ɔ́, yě ɖó e te, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Nɔ mǐ gɔ̌n, zǎn kó ɖo nǎ kú wɛ, ɖó hwe kó jɛ do.” É ka byɔ́ xwé gbe, bó nɔ yě gɔ̌n. "
"When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. ","Hwenu e é ka wá jɛ nǔ ɖu xá yě jí ɔ́, é sɔ́ wɔ̌xúxú, bó dó kú nú Mawu, bó kán, bó ná yě. "
"Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. ","Azɔn ɖokpó ɔ́, nukún yětɔn hun, bɔ yě mɔ nǔ jɛ wǔ tɔn, lobo tunwun ɖɔ Jezu wɛ; éyɛ́ ka bú sín yě tɛ́ntin, "
"They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?” ","bɔ yě nɔ ɖɔ nú yěɖée ɖɔ jí: “Hwenu e é ɖo xó ɖɔ nú mǐ wɛ ɖo alixo, bó ɖo Mawuxó tínmɛ nú mǐ wɛ ɔ́, akpakpa ɖé ma sɔ́ mǐ sín xomɛ a?” "
"They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, yě sí te tlóló, bó lɛ́ kɔ yi Jeluzalɛ́mu, bó mɔ mɛsɛ́dó wǒ-ɖokpó lɛ́ɛ kplé, kpódó gbɛ̌ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó. "

"Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread. ","Yě lɔ yí xó, bó ɖɔ nǔ e jɛ ɖo alixo ɔ́, lě e yě ká wá tunwun i gbɔn hwenu e é kán wɔ̌xúxú é. "
"While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.” ","Xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ wɛ yě ɖe, bɔ Jezu wá tɔ́n ɖo tɛ́ntin yětɔn, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Fífá ní nɔ kpɔ́ xá mi.” "
"They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. ","Xɛsi jɛ yě jí, bɔ ayi yětɔn gbadó, bɔ yě vɛdó ɖɔ nǔ mɔ wɛ émí ɖe sín. "
"He said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? ","Lo ɔ́, Jezu ɖɔ: “Ani ka ɖo ayi gbadó nú mi wɛ mɔ̌? Étɛ́ sín nǔ xo kpɔ́n wɛ mi ka ɖe? "
"Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.” ","Mi kpɔ́n alɔ ce lɛ́ɛ, bó kpɔ́n afɔ ce lɛ́ɛ; nyi ɖésúnɔ wɛ. Mi ɖó alɔ wú ce bó kpɔ́n; yɛ ɖé nɔ ɖó agbaza ǎ, é ka nɔ ɖó xú lě e nyɛ ɖó gbɔn bɔ mi mɔ é ǎ.” "

"And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?” ","Nǔ énɛ́ ɔ́ hun xomɛ nú yě, cóbó ka lɛ́ kpo ɖo yě kpácá wɛ, bɔ ɖěe yě ma yá wǔ ɖi nǔ ǎ ɔ́, Jezu kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Mi ɖó nǔɖuɖu ɖé ɖo fí a?” "
"They gave him a piece of broiled fish, ","Yě ká sɔ́ hweví hihi sínsɛ́n ɖokpó n'i, "
and he took it and ate it in their presence. ,"bɔ é yí, bó ɖu ɖo nukún yětɔn mɛ, "

Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. ,"Hwenɛ́nu wɛ é hun ayi yětɔn, bónú yě ná mɔ nǔ jɛ Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ. "

There came a man who was sent from God,Fon
"He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe. ","É wá ɖe kúnnu nú wěziza ɔ́, bónú mɛ bǐ ná dó ɖi nǔ nú wěziza ɔ́, gbɔn kúnnuɖiɖe tɔn gbla mɛ. "

The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world. ,"Wěziza énɛ́ ɔ́ wɛ nyí wěziza nǔgbó e wá gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ, bó hɔ́n dó gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ jí é. "

"He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. ","É wá mɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ gɔ́n, bɔ mɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ ka yí i ǎ. "
"Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God– ","Nǔ ɖo mɔ̌ có mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ ka yí i, bó ɖi nǔ n'i. É ná acɛ mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ, nú yě ná húzú Mawu ví. "

Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. ,"Jwifugán e ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu lɛ́ɛ sɛ́ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpódó Levíi ví lɛ́ɛ kpó dó, bónú yě ní yi kanbyɔ́ Jǎan ɖɔ mɛ nǎhún wɛ é ka nyí a jí. "

Now some Pharisees who had been sent ,Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌ ɖo mɛ e è sɛ́ dó Jǎan gɔ́n lɛ́ɛ mɛ. 
"questioned him, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” ","Bɔ yě kan xó élɔ́ byɔ́ ɛ: “Nú a ma nyí Klísu ɔ́ ǎ, bó ma nyí Elíi ǎ, bó ma ka nyí gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn ɔ́ ǎ ɔ́, étɛ́wútu a ka nɔ lɛ yɛhwesin nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ lo?” "
"“I baptize with water,” John replied, “but among you stands one you do not know. ","Jǎan yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Nyɛ ɔ́, sin wɛ un sɔ́ dó ɖo yɛhwesin lɛ nú mi wɛ; lo ɔ́, mɛ ɖokpó ɖo mi tɛ́ntin, bɔ mi tunwun mɛ e é nyí ɔ́ ǎ. "
"He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.” ","Mɛ énɛ́ wɛ nyí mɛ e ɖo gǔdo ce jǎwe ɔ́, bɔ un nyí mɛɖé bó sixú tún afɔkpakan tɔn lɛ́ɛ vɔ́vɔ́ ǎ.” "
"This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. ","Nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ jɛ ɖo Betaníi, ɖo Judɛ́ɛn tɔ ɔ́ gúdo, fí e Jǎan ɖo yɛhwesin lɛ nú mɛ ɖe wɛ é. "
"The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! ","Ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn ɔ́, Jǎan mɔ Jezu jǎwe bó ɖɔ: “Mi kpɔ́n! Lɛ̌ngbɔ́ví Mawu tɔn e nɔ sɔ́ hwɛ kɛ gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́ ɖíe. "
"This is the one I meant when I said, ‘A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.’ ","Mɛ e xó un ɖɔ nú mi bo ɖɔ: ‘Mɛ ɖé ɖo gǔdo ce jǎwe; mɛ énɛ́ hú gǎn mì, ɖó é ko ɖe cóbɔ è wá ji mì ɔ́ nɛ́.’ "
"I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.” ","Mɛ e é ná nyí ɔ́, nyɛ ɖésúnɔ ko tunwun ɖ'ayǐ ǎ; lo ɔ́, bónú Izlayɛ́li togun ɔ́ ná dó tunwun i wú wɛ un wá sɔ́ sin dó ɖo yɛhwesin lɛ nú mɛ wɛ.” "
Then John gave this testimony: “I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. ,"Jǎan ɖe kúnnu ɖɔ: “Un mɔ Yɛ Mawu tɔn gosín jǐxwé wá jɛ te dó jǐ tɔn ahwannɛ́ ɖɔhun, bó cí jǐ tɔn. "
"I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ ","Mɛ e é ná nyí ɔ́, nyɛ ɖésúnɔ ko tunwun ɖ'ayǐ ǎ.

I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.” ,"Nyi ɖésú wɛ mɔ nǔ e jɛ ɔ́, bó ɖe kúnnu ná ɖɔ é wɛ nyí Mawu ví.” "
The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. ,"Ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn ɔ́, Jǎan ko lɛ́ ɖo fí ɖokpó ɔ́, kpódó ahwanvú tɔn we kpó. "
"When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!” ","Ée é mɔ Jezu wá xweyǐgbe ɔ́, é ɖɔ: “Mi kpɔ́n! Lɛ̌ngbɔ́ví Mawu tɔn ɔ́ ɖíe.” "
"When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. ","Ée ahwanvú Jǎan tɔn we lɛ́ɛ se xó énɛ́ ɔ́, yě jɛ Jezu gúdo. "
"Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, “What do you want?” They said, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are you staying?” ","Jezu lílɛ́ kpan nukɔn yě, bó mɔ ɖɔ yě xwedó émí, lobo kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Ani ba wɛ mi ɖe?” Bɔ yě kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Fítɛ́ wɛ a nɔ́ nɔ, Hlabi?” Hlabi sín tínmɛ wɛ nyǐ Mɛ̌si.

"“Come,” he replied, “and you will see.” So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour. ","Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi wá kpɔ́n fí e un nɔ nɔ ɔ́.” Yě ká xwedó e, bo yi mɔ fí e é nɔ́ nɔ ɔ́, bó nɔ gɔ̌n tɔn gbe énɛ́ gbe. (Hwelɛ́kɔ gan ɛnɛ mɛ mɔ̌ wɛ nǔ énɛ́ ɔ́ ɖo jijɛ wɛ.) "
"Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. ","Andlé e nyí Sinmɔ́ɔ Piyɛ́ɛ sín nɔví ɔ́ lɔ ɖo mɛ we e se Jǎan sín xó, bo xwedó Jezu lɛ́ɛ mɛ. "
"The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, “We have found the Messiah” (that is, the Christ). ","Nǔ nukɔntɔn e Andlé bló ɔ́, é wɛ nyí ɖɔ é yi mɔ nɔví tɔn Sinmɔ́ɔ, bo ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Mǐ mɔ Mɛsíya ɔ́.” "
"And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which, when translated, is Peter ). ","Bɔ Andlé kplá nɔví tɔn Sinmɔ́ɔ yi Jezu gɔ́n.

"The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, “Follow me.” ","Ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn ɔ́, Jezu sɔ́ nǔ, bó xwe Galilée. É kpé Filípu, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Xwedó mì!” "
"Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. ","(Filípu ɔ́, Bɛtisayidanu wɛ, Andlé kpódó Piyɛ́ɛ kpó ɖɔhun.) "
"Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote–Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” ","Filípu yi mɔ Natanayɛ́li, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Mɛ e wú Mɔyízi sín sɛ́n lɛ́ɛ kpódó gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó ɖɔ xó dó ɔ́, mǐ mɔ ɛ.

"“Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?” Nathanael asked. “Come and see,” said Philip. ","Natanayɛ́li ka kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Nǔ ɖagbe ɖě ká sixú tɔ́n sín Nazalɛ́ti a?” Filípu ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Wǎ, bó wá kpɔ́n.” "
"When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, “Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false.” ","Đěe Jezu mɔ Natanayɛ́li jǎwe ɔ́, é ɖɔ dó wútu tɔn ɖɔ: “Mi kpɔ́n! Izlayɛ́li ví titewungbe ɖokpó ɖíe; é nɔ hízí nǔ ǎ.” "
"“How do you know me?” Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, “I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.” ","Đěe Natanayɛ́li se xó e Jezu ɖɔ dó wútu tɔn nɛ́ ɔ́, é kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Nɛ̌ a ka wa gbɔn bó tunwun mì?” Bɔ Jezu yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Hwenu e a kpo ɖo fígitínsá dɔ̌n ɔ́, un ko mɔ we, cóbɔ Filípu wá ylɔ́ we.” "
"Then Nathanael declared, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.” ","Natanayɛ́li yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌si, hwi wɛ nyí Mawu ví ɔ́ nǔgbó; hwi wɛ nyí Izlayɛ́li xɔ́sú.” "
"Jesus said, “You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that.” ",Jezu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Ée un ɖɔ nú we ɖɔ un mɔ we ɖo fígitínsá ɔ́ wútu wɛ a ɖi nǔ
"He then added, “I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there, ","Jezu lɛ́ ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Ma ɖɔ nǔgbó nú mi: mi ná mɔ jǐnukúnsin ná hun, bɔ wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ ná nɔ ɖo jǐ yi wɛ, bó ná nɔ ɖo te jɛ wɛ dó nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ jí.”Azǎn tɔn atɔngɔ́ ɔ́ gbe ɔ́, nya ɖé ɖo asi kplá wɛ ɖo Kana Galilée yíkúngban jí.

and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. ,"È ylɔ́ Jezu kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó, bɔ yě lɔmɔ̌ yi tɛn ɔ́ mɛ. "
"When the wine was gone, Jesus' mother said to him, “They have no more wine.” ","Ée vɛ̌ɛn wá vɔ ɔ́, Jezu sín nɔ wá ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Yě sɔ́ ɖó vɛ̌ɛn ɖě ǎ.” "
"“Dear woman, why do you involve me?” Jesus replied, “My time has not yet come.” ","Jezu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Nyɔ̌nu, é ma ka nyí hwi wɛ ná ɖɔ nǔ e un ná wa ɔ́ nú mì nɛ́; hwenu e un ná wa nǔ dó ɔ́ ko su ǎ.” "
"His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.” ",Nɔ tɔn ka ɖɔ nú nǔɖuɖumátɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Mi bló nǔ e é ná zɔ́n mi lɛ́ɛ bǐ.” 
"Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons. ","Dozɛ́n e è sɔ́ awǐnnya dó bló ná ɔ́ ayizɛ́n ká ɖo fínɛ́, bɔ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ nɔ dun sin dó yě mɛ, bó nɔ dó slá wǔ ná. Dozɛ́n énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó nɔ́ hɛn sin lǐtli kanwe (80) abǐ kantɔn (120) mɔ̌. "
"Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water”; so they filled them to the brim. ",Jezu ɖɔ nú nǔɖuɖumátɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Mi dun sin gɔ́ dozɛ́n élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ!” Bɔ yě dun sin gɔ́ yě flélé. 
"Then he told them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.” They did so, ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, Jezu ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi bo wún yi jó nú nǔɖuɖumátɔ́ lɛ́ɛ sín gǎn,” bɔ yě wún yi jó n'i. "
"and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside ","Nǔɖuɖumátɔ́ lɛ́ɛ sín gǎn ɔ́ ɖɔ́ sin e ko húzú vɛ̌ɛn ɔ́ kpɔ́n; é ka tunwun fí e vɛ̌ɛn énɛ́ gosín ɔ́ ǎ; (mɛsɛntɔ́ e yi dun sin ɔ́ lɛ́ɛ wɛ tunwun.)

"and said, “Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now.” ","bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Vɛ̌ɛn ɖagbe ɔ́ wɛ mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ nɔ ná mɛ jɛ nukɔn, bɔ hwenu e ahan wá ɖo mɛ jí yi wɛ ɔ́, è nɔ wá zán vɛ̌ɛn e ma nyɔ́ sɔ mɔ̌ ǎ é; bɔ hwɛ ka zé vɛ̌ɛn ɖagbe ɔ́ ɖ'ayǐ káká jɛ din.” "
"This, the first of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee. He thus revealed his glory, and his disciples put their faith in him. ","Nǔ nukɔn nukɔntɔn e Jezu jlɛ́ é nɛ́; Kana Galilée yíkúngban jí wɛ é jlɛ́ ɖe. Mɔ̌ wɛ Jezu ɖe susu tɔn xlɛ́ gbɔn, bɔ ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖi nǔ n'i. "
After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days. ,"Énɛ́ gúdo ɔ́, Jezu kpódó nɔ tɔn kpó, kpódó nɔví tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó, kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó wá yi Kafaanawúmu, bó nɔ fínɛ́ xɔ azǎn kpɛɖé. "
"When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. ","Ée Dǐndínwáyi sín xwe e Jwifu lɛ́ɛ nɔ ɖu ɔ́ sín azǎn ɖo sisɛyá wɛ ɔ́, Jezu yi Jeluzalɛ́mu. "
"In the temple courts he found men selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money. ","É mɔ mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖo sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́ mɛ, bɔ yě ɖo nyibú sa wɛ, bó ɖo gbɔ̌ sa wɛ, bó ɖo ahwannɛ́ sa wɛ. Akwɛ́ɖyɔ́tɔ́ lɛ́ɛ lɔ ɖo sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́ mɛ, bó ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n ɖo távo yětɔn lɛ́ɛ kɔn. "
"So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple area, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. ","Ée Jezu mɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, é sɔ́ kan dó bló bǎ ná, bó nya yě bǐ sín sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́ mɛ, yě kpódó gbɔ̌ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó, kpódó nyibú yětɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó.

"To those who sold doves he said, “Get these out of here! How dare you turn my Father's house into a market!” ","É ɖɔ nú ahwannɛ́satɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Mi bɛ́ nǔ mitɔn lɛ́ɛ, bó tɔ́n sín xɔ ɔ́ mɛ. Mi ma zé tɔ́ ce sín xwé dó húzú ajɔ̌xwé ná ó.” "
His disciples remembered that it is written: “Zeal for your house will consume me.” ,"Ée ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ mɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě flín xó élɔ́ e è wlǎn dó Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́: “Wǎn yíyí e un ɖó nú xwé towe ɔ́, wǎn yíyí ma ɖó jlɛ̌ ɖé wɛ, bó nɔ́ sɔ́ akpakpa mì.” "
"Then the Jews demanded of him, “What miraculous sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?” ","Lo ɔ́, Jwifu lɛ́ɛ yí xó, bó kanbyɔ́ Jezu ɖɔ: “Étɛ́ a ka ná jlɛ́ nú mǐ, bó ná dó ɖe xlɛ́ mǐ ɖɔ Mawu ná acɛ we ɖɔ a ní wa nǔ gbɔn mɔ̌?” "

But the temple he had spoken of was his body. ,"Lo ɔ́, sinsɛnxɔ e xó ɖɔ nú yě wɛ Jezu ɖe hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, agbaza é ɖésúnɔ tɔn wɛ. "
"After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the Scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.

"But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all men. ","Jezu ka gán jɛ yě wú ǎ, ɖó é tunwun yě bǐ ganjí; "
"He did not need man's testimony about man, for he knew what was in a man.Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council.

No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven–the Son of Man. ,Mɛ ɖěbǔ yi Mawu gɔ̌n kpɔ́n gbeɖé zɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví e jɛ te sín sɛ́xwé ɔ́ wú ǎ. 
"Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, ","Lě e Mɔyízi sɔ́ dan ɖó jǐ gbɔn ɖo gbětótló mɛ ɔ́, mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́ wɛ è nǎ sɔ́ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ ɖó jǐ, "
that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. ,"bónú mɛ e ná ɖi nǔ n'i ɔ́ ma dɔn ó; lo ɔ́, é ní mɔ gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ. "
"“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. ","Đó Mawu yí wǎn nú gbɛtɔ́ sɔ mɔ̌, bó sɔ́ Vǐɖokpónɔ tɔn jó, bónú mɛ e ná ɖi nǔ n'i lɛ́ɛ ɖěbǔ ma dɔn ó; lo ɔ́, yě bǐ ní mɔ gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ. "
"For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. ","Mawu sɛ́ Vǐ tɔn dó gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ, bónú é ná wá ɖó hwɛ nú gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ǎ; lo ɔ́, é ná wá hwlɛ́n yě gán wútu wɛ. "
"Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.

"This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. ","Nǔ e ka dɔn hwɛɖónúmɛ énɛ́ wá ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ: wěziza wá gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ, gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ka yí wǎn nú zǐnflú hú gǎn wěziza ɔ́, ɖó nǔ nyanya wiwa yětɔn lɛ́ɛ wútu. "
"Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. ","Nǔnyanyawatɔ́ nɔ gbɛ́ wǎn nú wěziza, bó nɔ lɔn ná sɛkpɔ́ ǎ; ɖó nǔ nyanya e é nɔ wa lɛ́ɛ táá wá jɛ wěxo. "
"But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.” ","Lo ɔ́, mɛ e nɔ xwedó nǔgbó ɖo nǔwiwa tɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɔ́ nɔ́ wá wěziza nu, bónú è nǎ mɔ nǔ jɛ ɖagbewiwa tɔn lɛ́ɛ wú; ɖó nǔwiwa tɔn lɛ́ɛ sɔgbe xá Mawu sín jlǒ.” "
"After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. ","Énɛ́ gúdo ɔ́, Jezu kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó yi Judée yíkúngban jí. Jezu nɔ fínɛ́ xá yě, bó ɖo yɛhwesin lɛ nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ. "
"Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were constantly coming to be baptized. ","Jǎan lɔ ɖo yɛhwesin lɛ nú mɛ wɛ ɖo Ayinɔ́ni, ɖo malín málín mɛ dó Salímu; ɖó sin sukpɔ́ ɖo fínɛ́. Mɛ lɛ́ɛ nɔ yi gɔ̌n tɔn, bɔ é nɔ lɛ yɛhwesin nú yě. "
(This was before John was put in prison.) ,È ko wlí Jǎan dó gankpá mɛ hwenɛ́nu ǎ. 
An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, Jǎan sín ahwanvú ɖé lɛ́ɛ wá ɖo nǔ dɔn xá Jwifu ɖokpó wɛ, dó wǔsláslá wú. "
"They came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan–the one you testified about–well, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.” ","Yě wǎ yi Jǎan gɔ́n, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌si, nya e kpódó hwi kpó nɔ Judɛ́ɛn tɔ ɔ́ gúdo dɔ̌n, bɔ a ɖe kúnnu n'i ɔ́ lɔmɔ̌ ɖo yɛhwesin lɛ nú mɛ wɛ, bɔ mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɖo gɔ̌n tɔn yi wɛ.” "
"To this John replied, “A man can receive only what is given him from heaven. ","Jǎan ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Mawu má ná nǔɖé mɛɖé ǎ ɔ́, é sixú mɔ ǎ. "
"You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of him.’ ","Mi ɖésúnɔ ná ɖe kúnnu nú mì ɖɔ un ɖɔ: ‘Un nyí Klísu ɔ́ ǎ; lo ɔ́, Mawu sɛ́ mì dó, bɔ un jɛ nukɔn n'i.’ "
"The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. ","Asisúnɔ tɔn wɛ nyí asi ɔ́; lo ɔ́, asisúnɔ sín xɔ́ntɔn e ɖo asisúnɔ ɔ́ kpá, bó ɖo gbe tɔn se wɛ ɔ́, xomɛ nɔ hun i.

The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. ,"Tɔ́ ɔ́ yí wǎn nú Vǐ ɔ́, bó sɔ́ nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ dó alɔ tɔn mɛ. "
"Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.”The Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John, ","Mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú Vǐ ɔ́, mɔ gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ; mɛ e ma ka se tónú nú vǐ ɔ́ ǎ ɔ́, é ná mɔ gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ ǎ; lo ɔ́, xomɛsin Mawu tɔn ɖo jǐ tɔn.”Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ se ɖɔ Jezu ɖo ahwan mɔ hú Jǎan wɛ, bó lɛ́ ɖo yɛhwesin lɛ nú mɛ hú Jǎan wɛ.

"When the Lord learned of this, he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee. ","Ée Jezu tunwun ɖɔ Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ se mɔ̌ ɔ́, é gosín Judée bo lɛ́ kɔ yi Galilée. "
Now he had to go through Samaria. ,"Ée é ka nyí Samalíi wɛ é ɖó ná gbɔn dín yi Galilée ɔ́, "
"So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph. ","é wá yi jɛ Samalíi toxo ɖé mɛ, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ toxo ɔ́ ɖɔ Sicáa; Sicáa lín dó gle e Jakɔ́bu ná vǐ tɔn Jozɛ́fu é ǎ. "
"Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour. ","Fínɛ́ wɛ sɛ́tɔ Jakɔ́bu tɔn ɖe. Jezu ɖo fínɛ́ jɛ wɛ gan wěwe mɛ mɔ̌. Nǔ cikɔ n'i, bɔ é gbɔ bo jínjɔ́n tɔ ɔ́ tó. "
"When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, “Will you give me a drink?” ","Ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ka yi nǔɖuɖu xɔ gbé ɖo toxo mɛ hwenɛ́nu. Hwenɛ́nu ɖokpó ɔ́, nyɔ̌nu Samalíinu ɖé wá sin dun gbé, bɔ Jezu ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Nǎ sin mì má nu.” "
"The Samaritan woman said to him, “You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans. ) ",Nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ ka yí gbe nú Jezu ɖɔ: “Nɛ̌ hwi mɛ e nyí Jwifu ɔ́ ka wá ɖo sin byɔ́ nyɛ mɛ e nyí Samalíinu é wɛ gbɔn?” (Đó Jwifu lɛ́ɛ nɔ jɛ kpɔ́ xá Samalíinu lɛ́ɛ ǎ.)

"“Sir,” the woman said, “you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? ","Nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ ka ɖɔ nú Jezu ɖɔ: “Mɛɖaxó! A ma ka ɖó nǔɖé, bó ná dó dun sin ɔ́ ná nɛ́, tɔ ɔ́ ka lɛ́ gɔ́ngɔ́n. Fítɛ́ a ka ná ba sin e nɔ ná gbɛ mɛ é sín? "

"Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, ","Jezu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Mɛɖěbǔ nu sin élɔ́ ɔ́, kɔ ná lɛ́ xú i. "
"but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.” ","Mɛ e ka ná nu sin e nyɛ ná ná ɛ ɔ́, kɔ sɔ́ ná xú i gbeɖé ǎ.

"The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ ɖɔ nú Jezu ɖɔ: “Mɛɖaxó, kɛnklɛ́n bó ná sin énɛ́ mì, nú kɔ ma sɔ́ xú mì, bónú ma lɛ́ tɔ́n sin dun gbé wá fí ó.” "
"He told her, “Go, call your husband and come back.” ",Jezu ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Yi ylɔ́ asú towe wá fí.” 
"“I have no husband,” she replied. Jesus said to her, “You are right when you say you have no husband. ","Bɔ nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Un ma ɖó asú nɛ́;” bɔ Jezu ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Un ɖó asú ǎ e a ɖɔ ɔ́, xó nǔgbó wɛ nyí bɔ a ɖɔ. "
"The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.” ","Đó a ko da asú atɔ́ɔ́n wá yi, bɔ mɛ e kpódó hwi kpó ɖo yiyi wɛ din ɔ́ lɔ nyí asú towe ǎ. Xó énɛ́ e a ɖɔ ɔ́, nǔgbó wɛ.” "

"Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.” ","Tɔ́gbó mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ sɛn Mawu ɖo só élɔ́ jí, bɔ mi mɛ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ka nɔ ɖɔ fí e è ɖǒ na sɛn Mawu ɖe ɔ́ wɛ nyí Jeluzalɛ́mu.” "

"You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews. ","Mi mɛ Samalíinu lɛ́ɛ tunwun nǔ e sɛn wɛ mi ɖe ɔ́ ǎ; lo ɔ́, mǐ mɛ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tunwun ɖɔ hwlɛngán ɔ́ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ gɔ́n wɛ é gosín. "
"Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.

"The woman said, “I know that Messiah” (called Christ) “is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.” ","Nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Un nywɛ́ ɖɔ Mɛsíya ɔ́ ɖó ná wá: (Mɛsíya ɔ́ sín tínmɛ wɛ nyí Klísu.) Bɔ hwenu e éyɛ́ ná wá ɔ́, é ná tín nǔ bǐ mɛ nú mǐ.” "
"Then Jesus declared, “I who speak to you am he.” ",Bɔ Jezu ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Nyɛ mɛ e nyí mɔ̌ ɔ́ ɖíe ɖo xó ɖɔ nú we wɛ e.” 
"Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?” ","Xó énɛ́ ɖɔ wɛ Jezu ɖe kɛ́ɖɛ́ bɔ ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ lɛ́ kɔ sín toxo mɛ wá.

"Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, ","Nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ jó tɔyizɛ́n tɔn dó, bo yi toxo ɔ́ mɛ, bó ɖɔ nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: "
"“Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ ?” ",“Mi vɛ́ wá kpɔ́n! Nya ɖě ɖíe! É ɖɔ nǔ e un wa ɔ́ bǐ nú mì. Klísu ɔ́ ná ko wɛ ǎ cé?” 
They came out of the town and made their way toward him. ,"Ée mɛ lɛ́ɛ se mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě tɔ́n sín toxo ɔ́ mɛ nǔgbó bó ɖidó Jezu gɔ́n. "
"Meanwhile his disciples urged him, “Rabbi, eat something.” ","Hwenɛ́nu wɛ ahwanvú Jezu tɔn lɛ́ɛ jɛ vo sa n'i jí ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌si, bo ka ɖu nǔ bó!” "
"But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.” ",Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Nǔɖuɖu e mi ma tunwun ǎ ɔ́ wɛ ɖo así ce.” 
"Then his disciples said to each other, “Could someone have brought him food?” ","Ée ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ se mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě jɛ ɖiɖɔ ɖo yěɖée tɛ́ntin jí ɖɔ: “Mɛ ɖé wɛ ka ko hɛn nǔɖuɖu wá n'i a?” "
"“My food,” said Jesus, “is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. ","Jezu ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Nǔɖuɖu ce wɛ nyí ɖɔ ma bló jlǒ mɛ e sɛ́ mì dó ɔ́ tɔn, bó ka wa azɔ̌ e é zɔ́n mì ɔ́ yi kpé. "
"Do you not say, ‘Four months more and then the harvest’? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest. ","Mi nɔ ɖɔ: ‘káká nú sun ná yi ɛnɛ mɔ̌ din ɔ́, è nǎ ya jinukún.’ Nyɛ ka ɖo ɖiɖɔ nú mi wɛ ɖɔ mi ní kpɔ́n gle lɛ́ɛ ganjí; jinukún lɛ́ɛ ko myá go, bó kó su yiya. "
"Even now the reaper draws his wages, even now he harvests the crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together. ","Nukún-yatɔ́ nɔ yí azɔ̌kwɛ́ tɔn, bó nɔ́ kplé nǔkún lɛ́ɛ nú gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ, bónú nǔdótɔ́ ɔ́ kpódó nukún-yatɔ́ ɔ́ kpó bǐ ná kplé, bó ná j'awǎ. "
Thus the saying ‘One sows and another reaps’ is true. ,"Hǔn nǔgbó ɖɔ wɛ è ɖe, bo ɖɔ: ‘Mɛ ɖěvo nɔ dó nǔ, bɔ mɛ ɖěvo nɔ ya’. "
"I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.” ","Un sɛ́ mi dó nukún ya gbé ɖo gle e mɛ mi ma wa azɔ̌ ɖe ǎ é. Mɛ ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ wɛ ko wa azɔ̌ ɖo gle ɔ́ mɛ, bɔ mi wá ɖo le tɔn ɖu wɛ.” "
"Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, “He told me everything I ever did.” ",Samalíinu e ɖo toxo énɛ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ gěgé ɖi nǔ nú Jezu
"So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wɛ zɔ́n, bɔ ée Samalíinu lɛ́ɛ wá yi mɔ Jezu ɔ́, yě sa vo n'i ɖɔ é ní nɔ émí gɔ́n kpɛɖé bɔ Jezu nɔ yě gɔ̌n xɔ azǎn we; "
And because of his words many more became believers. ,mɛ gěgé lɛ́ ɖi nǔ nú Jezu ɖó xó e é ɖésúnɔ ɖɔ nú yě ɔ́ wútu.

After the two days he left for Galilee. ,"Ée Jezu nɔ Samalíinu lɛ́ɛ gɔ́n xɔ azǎn we ɔ́, é gosín fínɛ́, bó ɖidó Galilée azǎn tɔn atɔngɔ́ ɔ́ gbe. "

"Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.

"“Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders,” Jesus told him, “you will never believe.” ","Jezu ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Ényí mi ma ko mɔ nǔjíjlɛ́ lɛ́ɛ kpódó nǔdábaɖa lɛ́ɛ kpó ǎ ɔ́, mi ná ɖi nǔ ǎ.” "

"Jesus replied, “You may go. Your son will live.” The man took Jesus at his word and departed. ","Jezu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Yi xwé, vǐ towe ɖo gbɛ.” Nya ɔ́ ka ɖi xó e Jezu ɖɔ n'i ɔ́, bó ɖidó xwé. "
"While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living. ","Xwé li jí ɔ́ wɛ é ɖe, bɔ mɛsɛntɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ wá kpé e, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Vǐ towe ɖo gbɛ!” "
"When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, “The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.” ","Bɔ nya ɔ́ kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Hwetɛ́nu mɔ̌ wɛ azɔn ɔ́ ka jɛ te kpɔ́n n'i jí?” Bɔ yě yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Sɔ hwemɛ, gan ɖokpó mɛ mɔ̌ wɛ avivɔ ɔ́ kɔ́n n'i.” "
"Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, “Your son will live.” So he and all his household believed. ",Vǐtɔ́ ɔ́ mɔ ɖɔ hwenɛ́nu pɛ́pɛ́pɛ́ wɛ Jezu ɖɔ: “Vǐ towe ɖo gbɛ.” Bɔ é kpódó xwédo tɔn bǐ kpó ɖi nǔ nú Jezu.

"When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, “Do you want to get well?” ","Ée Jezu mɔ azinzɔnnɔ énɛ́ ɔ́ ɖo ayǐmlɔ́mlɔ́ ɖo fínɛ́, bó ka tunwun ɖɔ é kó ɖo tɔ ɔ́ tó din ɔ́, é ko lín ɔ́, é kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “A jlǒ bónú azɔn towe ní gbɔ a?” "
"“Sir,” the invalid replied, “I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.” ","Azinzɔnnɔ ɔ́ ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ, un ɖó mɛɖé ɖo fí bɔ é ná sɔ́ mì dó sin ɔ́ mɛ hwenu e é nɔ xo dó ɔ́ ǎ; hwenu e un nɔ ɖo gǎn dó wɛ ɖɔ ma yi jɛ mɛ ɔ́, mɛ ɖěvo nɔ ko jɛ tɔ ɔ́ mɛ jɛ nukɔn nú mì.” "
"Then Jesus said to him, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.” ","Bɔ Jezu ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Sí te, sɔ́ zan towe bo zun zɔnlin.” "
"At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath, ","Azɔn ɖokpó ɔ́, azɔn tɔn gbɔ, bɔ é zé zan tɔn bó jɛ zɔnlin zun jí; gbe énɛ́ gbe ká nyí Jwifu lɛ́ɛ sín gbɔjɛzán gbe. "
"and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wútu ɔ́, Jwifugán lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ nú nya e azɔn gbɔ ná ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Égbé ɔ́, gbɔjɛzán gbe wɛ; a ɖǒ ná zé zan gbɔjɛzán gbe ǎ, sɛ́n mǐtɔn gbɛ́.” "
"But he replied, “The man who made me well said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’ ” ",Nya ɔ́ ká yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Mɛ e gbɔ azɔn nú mì ɔ́ wɛ ɖɔ nú mì ɖɔ: ‘Zě zan towe bo zun zɔnlin.’ ” 
"So they asked him, “Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?” ",Yě ká kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌ ká nyí mɛ e ɖɔ nú we ɖɔ: ‘Zě zan towe bo ɖi zɔnlin’ ɔ́?” 
"The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there. ","Lo ɔ́, nya ɔ́ mɔ nǔ jɛ mɛ e gbɔ azɔn n'i ɔ́ wú ǎ, ɖó Jezu gosín fínɛ́ ɖó agun e kplé ɖo fínɛ́ ɔ́ wútu. "
"Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, “See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, Jezu wá mɔ mɛ e é gbɔ azɔn ná ɔ́ ɖo sinsɛnxɔ mɛ, bo ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Đǒtó mì! Ée azɔn towe gbɔ din ɔ́, ma sɔ́ hu hwɛ ɖě ó, é ma nyí mɔ ǎ ɔ́, nǔ e nylá hú mɔ ɔ́ ná lɛ́ wá gbo we.” "
The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. ,"Bɔ nya ɔ́ gosín sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́ mɛ, bó ɖɔ nú Jwifugán lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ Jezu wɛ gbɔ azɔn nú émí. "
"So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews persecuted him. ","Nǔ e wú wɛ Jwifugán lɛ́ɛ jɛ Jezu gbé nya jí ɔ́ nɛ́, ɖó gbɔjɛzán gbe wɛ é wa nǔ énɛ́. "
"Jesus said to them, “My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working.” ","Jezu ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Tɔ́ ce ɖo azɔ̌ wa wɛ tɛgbɛ, bɔ nyɛ lɔ ɖo azɔ̌ wa wɛ.” "
"For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. ","Xó énɛ́ wútu wɛ Jwifugán lɛ́ɛ ma sɔ́ jló ná mɔ Jezu gbɔ ǎ, bó ɖo biba ná hu i wɛ; é ka nyí gbɔjɛzán e é ɖu su na ɔ́ kɛ́ɖɛ́ wú wɛ ǎ; lo ɔ́, é nɔ́ ɖɔ Mawu nyí Tɔ́ émítɔn, bó nɔ́ sɔ́ éɖée ɖó Mawu há jí. "
"Jesus gave them this answer: “I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does. ","Jezu yí xó, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Ma ɖɔ nǔgbó nú mi; Vǐ ɔ́ nɔ wa nǔɖé é ɖésúnɔ ǎ; nǔ e é mɔ bɔ Tɔ́ ɔ́ ɖo wiwa wɛ ɔ́ jɛ́n é lɔmɔ̌ nɔ wa; bɔ nǔ e Tɔ́ ɔ́ bló ɔ́, Vǐ ɔ́ lɔmɔ̌ nɔ bló. "
"For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these. ","Đó Tɔ́ ɔ́ yí wǎn nú Vǐ ɔ́, bo nɔ ɖe nǔwiwa tɔn lɛ́ɛ bǐ xlɛ́ ɛ; é ka na lɛ́ wá ɖe nǔwiwa e hú gǎn élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ é xlɛ́ ɛ, bɔ é ná kpácá mi. "
"For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it. ","Đó lě e Tɔ́ ɔ́ nɔ fɔ́n mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ, bó nɔ ná yě gbɛ gbɔn ɔ́, mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́ wɛ Vǐ ɔ́ lɔmɔ̌ nɔ ná gbɛ mɛ e jló e lɛ́ɛ gbɔn. "
"Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son, ",Tɔ́ ɔ́ nɔ ɖɔ hwɛ xá mɛɖé ǎ. É sɔ́ hwɛɖiɖɔ ɔ́ bǐ dó así nú Vǐ ɔ́
"that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him. ","bónú gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ná sɔ́ Vǐ ɔ́ su, lě e yě nɔ sɔ́ Tɔ́ ɔ́ su gbɔn é ɖɔhun. Mɛ e ma sɔ́ Vǐ ɔ́ su ǎ ɔ́, é sɔ́ Tɔ́ e sɛ́ ɛ dó ɔ́ lɔ su ǎ. "
"“I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life. ","“Má ɖɔ nǔgbó nú mi: mɛ e ɖótó xó ce, bó ɖi nǔ nú mɛ e sɛ́ mì dó ɔ́ kó mɔ gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ, bɔ è sɔ́ ná ɖó hwɛ n'i ǎ, ɖó é kó xo kú zlɛ́ wá gbɛ. "
"I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live. ","Má ɖɔ nǔgbó nú mi: hwe ɔ́ nu ɖo na su wɛ; éɖíe ka ko su e, bɔ mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ ná se Mawu ví ɔ́ sín gbe; énɛ́ ɔ́, mɛ e ná se gbe tɔn lɛ́ɛ ná mɔ gbɛ. "
"For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself. ","Đó lě e Tɔ́ ɔ́ ɖó acɛ, bó nɔ ná gbɛ mɛ gbɔn ɔ́, mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́ wɛ é ná ɛ acɛ, bɔ élɔ́ ná ná gbɛ mɛ. "
And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man. ,"Mawu ná acɛ ɛ, bɔ é ná ɖɔ hwɛ xá gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, ɖó Gbɛtɔ́ví wɛ é nyí. "
"“Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice ","Hwenu e mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ ná se gbe tɔn, bó ná fɔ́n ɔ́ ko sɛ yá; mi ma nú é kpácá mi ó. "
"and come out–those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned. ","Yě ná tɔ́n sín yɔdo yětɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ; mɛ e wa nǔ ɖagbe lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, Mawu ná fɔ́n yě sín kú, bó ná ná yě gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ. Lo ɔ́, mɛ e wa nǔ nyanya lɛ́ɛ ná fɔ́n sín kú, bónú Mawu ná ɖó hwɛ nú yě.” "
"By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me. ","“Un sixú wa nǔɖé ɖo nyɛ ɖésúnɔ sín acɛ mɛ ǎ. Nǔ e Mawu ɖɔ nú mì ɔ́ wɛ un nɔ xwedó dó ɖɔ hwɛ xá mɛ, bɔ un nɔ dó hwɛjijɔ, ɖó jlǒ nyɛ ɖésúnɔ tɔn wɛ un nɔ wa ǎ; lo ɔ́, mɛ e sɛ́ mì dó ɔ́ sín jlǒ wɛ un nɔ wa. "
"“If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid. ","“Ényí nyɛ ɖésú wɛ na ɖe kúnnu nú nyɛɖée ɔ́, xó e ɖɔ wɛ un ɖe ɔ́ sixú ɖe xlɛ́ ɖɔ nǔgbó ɖɔ wɛ un ɖe ǎ. "
"There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is valid. ","Mɛ ɖěvo wɛ ka ɖo kúnnu ɖe nú mì wɛ, bɔ un tunwun ɖɔ xó e é ɖɔ dó wútu ce lɛ́ɛ nyí nǔgbó. "
“You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth. ,"Mi sɛ́ mɛ dó Jǎan, bɔ é ɖe kúnnu nú nǔgbó ɔ́. "
Not that I accept human testimony,Fon
"John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light. ","Jǎan cí zogbɛ́n e ɖo títá é ɖɔhun nú mi, bɔ mi yí gbe bó j'awǎ kpɛɖé ɖo wěziza tɔn nu. "
"“I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the very work that the Father has given me to finish, and which I am doing, testifies that the Father has sent me. ","Nǔ ɖěvo ka ɖo kúnnu ɖe nú mì wɛ, bó hú gǎn kúnnu e Jǎan ɖe nú mì é. Azɔ̌ e Tɔ́ ce sɔ́ dó así nú mì, bɔ un ɖo wiwa wɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖe kúnnu nú mì bo ɖe xlɛ́ ɖɔ é wɛ sɛ́ mì dó nǔgbó. "
"And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form, ",Tɔ́ e sɛ́ mì dó ɔ́ ɖésú ɖe kúnnu nú mì. Mi ka se gbe tɔn kpɔ́n ǎ
"nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent. ",mi ka hɛn xó tɔn ayi mɛ ǎ
"You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about me, ","Mi nɔ ɖo Mawuxówéma ɔ́ kplɔ́n wɛ, ɖó mi nɔ lin ɖɔ é mɛ wɛ émí ná mɔ gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ ɖe; lo ɔ́, Mawuxó e è wlán lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, nyɛ wɛ yě ɖe kúnnu ná. "
yet you refuse to come to me to have life. ,"Có mi ka jló ná wá gɔ̌n ce, bó ná mɔ gbɛ jɔ gbɛ ɔ́ ǎ. "
"“I do not accept praise from men, ",“Gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ní kpa susu nú mì ba wɛ un ɖe ǎ. 
but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts. ,"Đó un tunwun mi, bó mɔ ɖɔ mi kún yí wǎn nú Mawu ó. "
"I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him. ","Tɔ́ ce sín nyǐkɔ mɛ wɛ un wá dó, bɔ mi ka yí mì ǎ; é ka nyí mɛ ɖěvo wɛ ka wá ɖo nyǐkɔ é ɖésúnɔ tɔn mɛ ɔ́, mi ná yí i. "
"How can you believe if you accept praise from one another, yet make no effort to obtain the praise that comes from the only God ? ","Mi mɛ e nɔ ɖo susu kpa nú miɖée wɛ, bó ma nɔ ba nú Mawu ná sɔ́ mi su ǎ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, nɛ̌ mi ka sixú ɖi nǔ gbɔn? "
"“But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set. ",Mi ma lin ɖɔ nyɛ wɛ ná dó hwɛ mi ɖo Tɔ́ ce nukɔn ó
"If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me. ","Ényí mi ko ɖi nǔ nú Mɔyízi wɛ ɔ́, mi ná ko ɖi nǔ nú nyɛ lɔmɔ̌; ɖó nǔ e Mɔyízi wlán ɔ́, nyɛ wú wɛ é ɖɔ xó dó. "
"But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?”Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias), ","Ée mi ma ka ɖi nǔ e Mɔyízi wlán lɛ́ɛ ǎ ɔ́, nɛ̌ mi ka sixú ɖi xó ce lɛ́ɛ gbɔn?”Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, Jezu dó asá Galilée tɔ e è nɔ lɛ́ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Tibɛliadi ɔ́, bó jɛ agě ɖě ɔ́ jí dɔ̌n.

and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the miraculous signs he had performed on the sick. ,"Ahwan wɔ̌buwɔ́bú ɖé xwedó Jezu, ɖó mɛ lɛ́ɛ mɔ nǔ e jlɛ́ wɛ é ɖe, bó ɖo azɔn gbɔ nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ é. "
Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples. ,"Jezu xá só ɖé jí, lobo jínjɔ́n ayǐ ɖo fínɛ́ é kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó. "
The Jewish Passover Feast was near. ,Jwifu lɛ́ɛ sín xwe e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Dǐndínwáyi ɔ́ ko sɛ yá. 
"When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, “Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?” ","Jezu zé ta bó mɔ ahwan wɔ̌buwɔ́bú ɖé ja gɔ̌n tɔn, lobo ɖɔ nú Filípu ɖɔ: “Fítɛ́ mǐ ná mɔ nǔɖuɖu xɔ ɖe, bɔ é ná kpé mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ?” "
"He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do. ","Jezu ɖɔ mɔ̌, bó ná dó kpɔ́n nǔ e Filípu ná ɖɔ ɔ́, ɖó é ɖésúnɔ kó tunwun nǔ e wa gbé é ja é. "
"Philip answered him, “Eight months' wages would not buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!” ","Filípu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “È na bo sɔ́ gankwɛ́ afɔɖé (200) ɖó te, bó dó xɔ nǔɖuɖu ná ɔ́, é ná kpé nú yě ɖokpó ɖokpó ná mɔ kpɛɖé kpɛɖé ǎ.” "
"Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up, ","Ahwanvú Jezu tɔn ɖěvo e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Andlé, bɔ é nyí Sinmɔ́ɔ Piyɛ́ɛ sín nɔví ɔ́ ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: "
"“Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?” ","“Nyaví ɖé ɖo fí, bó hɛn wɔ̌xúxú atɔ́ɔ́n kpódó hweví we kpó; fítɛ́ nǔ énɛ́ ka sixú jɛ nú mɛ tobutóbú élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ?” "
"Jesus said, “Have the people sit down.” There was plenty of grass in that place, and the men sat down, about five thousand of them. ","Jezu ka ɖɔ nú ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Mi ɖɔ nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ nú yě ní jínjɔ́n ayǐ.” Gběhan wɛ́lɛ́wɛ́lɛ́ ka sukpɔ́ ɖo tɛn énɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ, bɔ yě bǐ jínjɔ́n jí. Súnnu mɛxó e ɖo yě mɛ lɛ́ɛ ná yi děgba ɖě afatɔ́n (5.000) mɔ̌. "
"Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish. ","Jezu ka fɔ wɔ̌xúxú lɛ́ɛ, bó dó kú nú Mawu, bó má nú mɛ e jínjɔ́n ayǐ ɖo fínɛ́ lɛ́ɛ; mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, é má hweví lɛ́ɛ nú yě, bɔ mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó yí lě e é jló e gbɔn é. "
"When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, “Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted.” ","Đěe yě bǐ ɖu nǔ bó gɔ́ xo ɔ́, Jezu ɖɔ nú ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Mi bɛ́ nǔ e yě ɖu kpo lɛ́ɛ bǐ, bónú ɖě ma yi gbě ó.” "
So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten. ,"Ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ka bɛ́ nǔ e yě ɖu kpo, ɖo wɔ̌xúxú atɔ́ɔ́n lɛ́ɛ mɛ é bǐ, bɔ é gɔ́ xasun wěwe. "
"After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they began to say, “Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.” ","Ée mɛ lɛ́ɛ mɔ nǔ énɛ́ e Jezu jlɛ́ ɔ́, yě ɖɔ: “Gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn e ɖó ná wá gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́ wɛ é nyí nǔgbó.” "
"Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself. ","Ée Jezu mɔ ɖɔ yě ná wá sɔ́ émí kpó hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n kpó, bó ná sɔ́ émí axɔ́sú ɔ́, é gosín fínɛ́, bó tunta sókan ɔ́ mɛ é ɖokpónɔ. "
"When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, ","Ée gbadanu wá su ɔ́, ahwanvú Jezu tɔn lɛ́ɛ jɛ te wá Galilée tɔ ɔ́ tó, "
"where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them. ","bó byɔ́ tɔjíhún mɛ, bó tunta Kafaanawúmu; zǎn ko kú, bɔ Jezu ka ko xwedó yě wú ǎ. "
A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough. ,"Tɔ ɔ́ ɖo adǎn jí hwenɛ́nu, ɖó jɔhɔn ɖaxó ɖé ɖo nyinyi wɛ. "
"When they had rowed three or three and a half miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were terrified. ","Hwenu e ahwanvú Jezu tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖo hǔn ɔ́ kun wɛ, bó ko bló kilomɛ́tlu atɔ́ɔ́n abǐ ayizɛ́n mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě mɔ Jezu, bɔ é ɖo zɔnlin ɖi wɛ gbɔn tɔ ɔ́ jí ja yě gɔ̌n, bɔ xɛsi jɛ yě jí. "
"But he said to them, “It is I; don't be afraid.” ","É ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Nyɛ wɛ, mi ma ɖi xɛsi ó.” "
"Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading. ","Bɔ ée yě jló ná sɔ́ ɛ dó hǔn ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, tlóló ɔ́, hǔn ɔ́ yi glín dó tɔ ɔ́ tó, fí e yě xwe é. "
"The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone. ","Gbe e gbe Jezu na nǔɖuɖu mɛ ɔ́ sín ayǐhɔ́ngbe ɔ́, mɛ lɛ́ɛ flín ɖɔ tɔjíhún ɖokpó géé jɛ́n wɛ ɖo tɔ ɔ́ jí, bɔ ahwanvú Jezu tɔn lɛ́ɛ sɔ́ bó ɖidó; Jezu ka xwedó yě ǎ, yě ɖokpónɔ wɛ byɔ́ hǔn ɔ́ mɛ. "
Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. ,"Lo ɔ́, Tibɛliadi sín tɔjíhún ɖé lɛ́ɛ glín ɖo fí e Aklúnɔ zé wɔ̌xúxú bó dó kú nú Mawu bɔ yě ɖu ɖe é. "
"Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus. ","Bɔ ée mɛ lɛ́ɛ ma sɔ́ mɔ Jezu ǎ, bó ma ka sɔ́ lɛ́ mɔ ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ lɔ ǎ ɔ́, yě byɔ́ tɔjíhún énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ mɛ, bó ɖidó Jezu ba gbé ɖo Kafaanawúmu. "
"When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?” ","Ée yě wǎ yi mɔ Jezu ɖo tɔ ɔ́ gúdo dɔ̌n ɔ́, yě kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌si, hwetɛ́nu a ka wá yí dě dó?” "
"Jesus answered, “I tell you the truth, you are looking for me, not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. ","Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Má ɖɔ nǔgbó nú mi: nǔ e un jlɛ́ bɔ mi mɔ lɛ́ɛ wútu wɛ mi ɖo biba mì wɛ ǎ. Lo ɔ́, wɔ̌xúxú e mi ɖu gɔ́ xo ɔ́ wútu wɛ mi ɖo biba mì wɛ. "
"Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you.

"Then they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?” ","Yě ká kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Nɛ̌ mǐ ká ná bló gbɔn, bó wa mawuzɔ̌ lɛ́ɛ?” "
"Jesus answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.” ",Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Nǔ e Mawu jló ɖɔ mi ní wa ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ mi ní ɖi nǔ nú mɛ e é sɛ́ dó é.”

Our forefathers ate the manna in the desert,Fon
"Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.

For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.” ,"Đó nǔɖuɖu e Mawu ná ɔ́ wɛ nyí mɛ e jɛ te sín jǐxwé, bó ná gbɛ jɔ gbɛ ɔ́ é.” "
"“Sir,” they said, “from now on give us this bread.” ",Yě ká ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ! Bo nɔ ná nǔɖuɖu énɛ́ mǐ tɛgbɛ.” 
"Then Jesus declared, “I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty. ","Jezu ka lɛ́ yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Nyɛ wɛ nyí nǔɖuɖu e nɔ ná gbɛ jɔ gbɛ mɛ é. Mɛ e wá gɔ̌n ce ɔ́, xovɛ́ sɔ́ ná sin i gbeɖé ǎ. Mɛ e ka ɖi nǔ nú mì ɔ́, kɔ sɔ́ ná xú i gbeɖé ǎ. "
"But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. ","Lo ɔ́, un ko ɖɔ nú mi; mi ko mɔ mì, cóbɔ mi ka ɖi nǔ nú mì ǎ. "
"All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. ","Mɛ e Tɔ́ ɔ́ ná mì lɛ́ɛ bǐ ná wá gɔ̌n ce; mɛ e ka wá gɔ̌n ce ɔ́, un ná ɖe e tɔ́n ǎ. "
For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. ,"Đó un jɛ te sín jǐxwé, bó ná bló jlǒ ce ǎ; lo ɔ́, nǔ e jló mɛ e sɛ́ mì dó ɔ́ bló gbé un ja bo wá. "
"And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. ","Mɛ e sɛ́ mì dó ɔ́ sín jlǒ wɛ ka nyí ɖɔ un ma hɛn mɛ ɖokpó bú ɖo mɛ e é sɔ́ dó así nú mì lɛ́ɛ mɛ ó; lo ɔ́, nú ma fɔ́n yě bǐ sín kú ɖo azǎn gǔdo gúdo tɔn ɔ́ gbe. "

"At this the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.” ","Ée Jwifu e gbɛ́ wǎn nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ se xó énɛ́ ɔ́, yě jɛ nǔ hlún ɖɔ dó Jezu wú jí, ɖó é ɖɔ “Nyɛ wɛ nyí nǔɖuɖu e jɛ te sín jǐxwé é.” "

"“Stop grumbling among yourselves,” Jesus answered. ","Jezu yí xó, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi gbɔ nǔ hlún ɖɔ ɖo miɖée tɛ́ntin. "

It is written in the Prophets: ‘They will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me. ,"Gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ ko wlán ɖ'ayǐ ɖɔ: ‘Mawu ɖésú wɛ ná kplɔ́n nǔ yě bǐ.’ Mɛ e ɖótó Tɔ́ ɔ́, bó se nǔkplɔ́nmɛ tɔn ɔ́, mɛ énɛ́ ná wá gɔ̌n ce. "

"Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died. ","Tɔ́gbó mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖu mǎna ɖo gbětótló mɛ, có yě ká kú. "
"But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not die. ","Amɔ̌, nǔɖuɖu élɔ́ e jɛ te sín jǐxwé ɔ́, nǔɖuɖu ɖé wɛ bɔ mɛɖé ɖu ɔ́, é ná kú ǎ. "
"I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever.

"Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” ","Jwifu e gbɛ́ wǎn nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ ka jɛ nǔ dɔn jí syɛ́nsyɛ́n ɖo yěɖée tɛ́ntin bo nɔ ɖɔ: “Nɛ̌ nya élɔ́ ká sixú ná agbaza tɔn mǐ, bɔ mǐ na ɖu gbɔn?” "
"Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. ","Jezu yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Má ɖɔ nǔgbó nú mi: ényí mi ma ɖu nyɛ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ sín agbaza, bó nu hun ce ǎ ɔ́, gbɛ jɔ gbɛ ɔ́ ná nɔ mi mɛ ǎ. "

"Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. ","Tɔ́ ɔ́ e sɛ́ mì dó ɔ́ ɖo gbɛ, bɔ nyɛ ka ɖo gbɛ ɖo acɛ tɔn mɛ. Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, mɛɖé ɖu agbaza ce ɔ́, é ná nɔ gbɛ gbɔn acɛ ce mɛ. "

He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. ,Nǔ e Jezu ɖɔ hwenu e é ɖo nǔ kplɔ́n mɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ ɖo Kafaanawúmu ɖo kplɔ́ngbasá Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn ɔ́ nɛ́.

"Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, “Does this offend you? ","Jezu mɔ ɖɔ ahwanvú émítɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖo nǔ hlún ɖɔ dó xó énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ, bó kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Xó énɛ́ e un ɖɔ ɔ́ ná nyí afɔklɛ́nnú nú mi wɛ a? "
What if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before! ,"Ényí mi ka wá mɔ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ xwe jǐxwé fí e é ko ɖe ɖ'ayǐ ɔ́, nɛ̌ ka ná cí gbɔn nú mi lo? "
The Spirit gives life,Fon
Yet there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him. ,"Lo ɔ́, mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖo mi mɛ bó ɖi nǔ ǎ.” Đó sín do wɛ Jezu ko tunwun mɛ e ma ɖi nǔ ǎ lɛ́ɛ, kpódó mɛ e ɖo ná sa ɛ ɖu wɛ ɔ́ kpó. "
"He went on to say, “This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled him.” ","Jezu lɛ́ ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ jí: “Nǔ e wú un ɖɔ ényí Mawu ma ná gbe tɔn mɛɖé ǎ ɔ́, mɛ ɔ́ kún sixú wá gɔ̌n ce ó é nɛ́.” "
From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him. ,"Sín hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, ahwanvú Jezu tɔn gěgé lɛ́ kɔ, bó sɔ́ nɔ xwedó e ǎ. "
"“You do not want to leave too, do you?” Jesus asked the Twelve. ",Jezu ka kanbyɔ́ mɛ wěwe lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Mi lɔmɔ̌ mi jló ná yi a?” 
"Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. ",Sinmɔ́ɔ Piyɛ́ɛ ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ! Mɛ̌ gɔ́n mǐ ka ná lɛ́ yi? É má nyí nu towe wɛ è nɔ se xó e nɔ ná gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ mɛ ɔ́ ɖe ǎ cé?

"Then Jesus replied, “Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!” ","Jezu ka lɛ́ ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ jí: “Nyɛ ɖésú wɛ cyán mi mɛ wěwe lɛ́ɛ, cóbɔ mɛ ɖokpó ka ɖo mi mɛ bó nyí awǒvigbɛtɔ́.” "
"(He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.)After this, Jesus went around in Galilee, purposely staying away from Judea because the Jews there were waiting to take his life. ","Judási Sinmɔ́ɔ Isikaliɔ́ti ví ɔ́ xó ɖɔ wɛ Jezu ɖe; ɖó é lɔmɔ̌ ɖo ahwanvú wěwe lɛ́ɛ mɛ, cóbó ka ɖo Jezu ná sa wɛ.Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, Jezu ɖo to e ɖo Galilée gbé jí lɛ́ɛ mɛ gbɔn wɛ; é ka jló ná yi gbɔn Judée ǎ, ɖó Jwifugán lɛ́ɛ ɖo biba ná hu i wɛ.

"But when the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near, ","Xwe e Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ja ɖuɖu gbé ɔ́, yě nɔ dó azava bó nɔ́ nɔ sá ɔ́ ko sɛ yá. "
"Jesus' brothers said to him, “You ought to leave here and go to Judea, so that your disciples may see the miracles you do. ","Bɔ Jezu sín nɔví lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Yi Judée, bónú ahwanvú towe lɛ́ɛ lɔ ná mɔ azɔ̌ e a nɔ wa lɛ́ɛ. "
"No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things, show yourself to the world.” ","Đó mɛ ɖěbǔ jló ɖɔ è nǐ tunwun émí ɔ́, mɛ ɔ́ nɔ́ wa nǔ dó nǔglɔ́ ǎ; ée a ko nɔ jlɛ́ nǔ ɔ́, blǒ bónú mɛ bǐ ní tunwun we.” "
For even his own brothers did not believe in him. ,Đó nɔví tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖésú ɖi nǔ n'i ǎ. 
"Therefore Jesus told them, “The right time for me has not yet come; for you any time is right. ","Jezu ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Gan ce ko xo ǎ; lo ɔ́, midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, hwe lɛ́ɛ bǐ nu wɛ nyɔ́ nú mi. "
"The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that what it does is evil. ","Gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ sixú gbɛ́ wǎn nú midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ǎ; lo ɔ́, yě gbɛ́ wǎn nú nyɛ, ɖó un nɔ ɖe kúnnu ɖɔ nǔwiwa yětɔn lɛ́ɛ kún nyɔ́ ó. "
"You go to the Feast. I am not yet going up to this Feast, because for me the right time has not yet come.” ",Midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ mi yi ɖu xwe ɔ́
"Having said this, he stayed in Galilee. ","Ée Jezu ɖɔ mɔ̌ nú yě ɔ́, é cí Galilée. "
"However, after his brothers had left for the Feast, he went also, not publicly, but in secret. ","Ée Jezu sín nɔví lɛ́ɛ yi xwe ɔ́ ɖu gbé gúdo ɔ́, é lɔmɔ̌ wá bɛ yɛ, bó yi xwe ɔ́ tɛn mɛ. "
"Now at the Feast the Jews were watching for him and asking, “Where is that man?” ","Jwifugán lɛ́ɛ ba ɛ xwe ɔ́ hwenu káká, yě ká mɔ ɛ ǎ, bó nɔ́ ɖɔ: “Fítɛ́ é ka ɖe ɖo mɛ lɛ́ɛ mɛ tawun?” "
"Among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him. Some said, “He is a good man.” Others replied, “No, he deceives the people.” ","Mɛ gěgé ɖo mɛ lɛ́ɛ mɛ, bo zé gbe dó do, bo nɔ ɖo xó ɖɔ dó wútu tɔn wɛ, bó nɔ́ ɖɔ: “Gbɛtɔ́ ɖagbe wɛ nyí nya ɔ́ mɛ!” Mɛɖě ká nɔ ɖɔ: “Éeǒ; mɛblɛ́ɖutɔ́ ɖé kpowun wɛ.” "
But no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the Jews. ,"Lo ɔ́, mɛ e ɖo xó tɔn ɖɔ wɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖě nɔ glá zé gbe dó jǐ ǎ, ɖó yě ɖo xɛsi ɖi nú Jwifugán lɛ́ɛ wɛ. "
Not until halfway through the Feast did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach. ,"Yě ɖo xwe ɔ́ ɖu wɛ, bó ko vlɔ́ azǎn nabí e yě ná dó ɖu ná ɔ́ ɖó we, bɔ Jezu yi sinsɛnxɔ mɛ, bó jɛ nǔ kplɔ́n mɛ jí. "
"The Jews were amazed and asked, “How did this man get such learning without having studied?” ",Lě e kplɔ́n nǔ mɛ gbɔn wɛ é ɖe ɔ́ kpácá Jwifugán lɛ́ɛ káká bɔ yě nɔ ɖɔ: “Nya élɔ́ má ka yi wěmaxɔmɛ kpɔ́n nɛ́! Nɛ̌ é ká wa gbɔn bó tunwun Mawuxówéma ɔ́ sɔ mɔ̌?” 
"Jesus answered, “My teaching is not my own. It comes from him who sent me. ",Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Nyɛ wɛ ɖó nǔ e kplɔ́n mi wɛ un ɖe ɔ́ ǎ
"If anyone chooses to do God's will, he will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own. ","Mɛ e ɖó jlǒ, bó ná wa jlǒ Mawu tɔn ɔ́, ényí nǔkplɔ́nmɛ ce ɔ́, Mawu gɔ́n wɛ é gosín abǐ acɛ nyɛ ɖésúnɔ tɔn wɛ ɔ́, é ná mɔ do ná. "
"He who speaks on his own does so to gain honor for himself, but he who works for the honor of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him. ","Mɛ e ka ɖo é ɖésúnɔ sín susu ba wɛ ɔ́, acɛ é ɖésúnɔ tɔn mɛ wɛ é nɔ ɖɔ xó dó. Lo ɔ́, mɛ e ɖo mɛ e sɛ́ ɛ dó ɔ́ sín susu ba wɛ ɔ́, nǔgbó wɛ é nɔ ɖɔ, bɔ xó tɔn ɖě nɔ́ nyí nǔvú ǎ. "
Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?” ,"Mɔyízi ko ná sɛ́n lɛ́ɛ mi; lo ɔ́, mi mɛ ɖokpó nɔ́ nyi sɛ́n lɛ́ɛ ǎ; bɔ étɛ́ wú mi ka ɖo nǎ hu mì wɛ?” "
"“You are demon-possessed,” the crowd answered. “Who is trying to kill you?” ",Ahwan ɔ́ yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Yɛ nyanya wɛ ɖo jǐ towe
"Jesus said to them, “I did one miracle, and you are all astonished. ","Jezu yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Nǔ ɖokpó wɛ un wa, bɔ é kpácá mi sɔ mɔ̌. "
"Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but from the patriarchs), you circumcise a child on the Sabbath. ","Mɔyízi hɛn adagbigbo sɛ́n ɔ́ wá nú mi; (é wɛ ka jɛ sɛ́n énɛ́ nyi jí jɛ nukɔn ǎ, tɔ́gbó mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ wɛ jɛ jí dó nukɔn), có gbɔjɛzán gbe lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌ ɔ́, mi nɔ gbo ada nú mɛ. "
"Now if a child can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for healing the whole man on the Sabbath? ",É ma nyí Mɔyízisɛ́n ɔ́ nyi wɛ mi ɖe bó nɔ́ gbo ada nú mɛ gbɔjɛzán gbe a? Étɛ́wú mi ka ɖo xomɛ sin dó nyɛ mɛ e gbɔ azɔn nú gbɛtɔ́ blěbǔ ɖokpó gbɔjɛzán gbe ɔ́ wɛ. 
"Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment.” ","Mi ma nɔ nɔ gbɛtɔ́ jí ó, mi nɔ nɔ xó jí.” "
"At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask, “Isn't this the man they are trying to kill? ",Jeluzalɛ́munu ɖé lɛ́ɛ nɔ ɖɔ: “É ma nyí nya e wú lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó wɛ yě ɖe bo na hu ɔ́ nɛ́ a? 
"Here he is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying a word to him. Have the authorities really concluded that he is the Christ ? ",É nɛ́ ka ɖo xó ɖɔ wɛ ɖo agbawungba nɛ́

"Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, “Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from. I am not here on my own, but he who sent me is true. You do not know him, ","Hwenu e Jezu ɖo nǔ kplɔ́n mɛ wɛ ɖo sinsɛnxɔ mɛ ɔ́, é sú xó, bó ɖɔ: “Mi tunwun mì, bó tunwun fí e un gosín é.

but I know him because I am from him and he sent me.” ,"Nyɛ tunwun i, ɖó gɔ̌n tɔn wɛ un gosín; é wɛ sɛ́ mì dó.” "
"At this they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his time had not yet come. ","Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, yě jló ná wlí i, mɛ ɖěbǔ sín alɔ ka jɛ wú tɔn ǎ, ɖó gan tɔn ko xo ǎ. "
"Still, many in the crowd put their faith in him. They said, “When the Christ comes, will he do more miraculous signs than this man?” ","Mɛ gěgé ɖo agun ɔ́ mɛ bó ɖi nǔ n'i, bó nɔ́ ɖɔ: “Nú Klísu ɔ́ na bo wá ɔ́, é sɔ́ ná lɛ́ jlɛ́ nǔ hú nya élɔ́ wɛ a?” "
The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him. ,"Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ se nǔ e mɛ lɛ́ɛ zé gbe dó do, bó ɖo ɖiɖɔ dó Jezu wú wɛ ɖo agun ɔ́ mɛ é, bɔ yě ɖó gbe kpɔ́ xá vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ, bó sɛ́ sɔ́ja dó, bó ná wlí Jezu.

"Jesus said, “I am with you for only a short time, and then I go to the one who sent me. ","Jezu ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Hwenu kpɛɖé jɛ́n kpo, bɔ un ná dó nɔ mi mɛ; énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, un na lɛ́ kɔ yi mɛ e sɛ́ mì dó ɔ́ gɔ́n. "
"You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come.” ","Mi ná ba mì, mi ka ná mɔ mì ǎ; ɖó mi ná sixú wá fí e un ɖe ɔ́ ǎ.” "
"The Jews said to one another, “Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?

"What did he mean when he said, ‘You will look for me, but you will not find me,’ and ‘Where I am, you cannot come’?” ","Bɔ étɛ́ ná ɖɔ wɛ é ka ɖe bó ɖɔ: ‘Mi ná ba mì, mi ka ná mɔ mì ǎ, ɖó mi ná sixú wá fí e un ɖe ɔ́ ǎ.’ ” "
"On the last and greatest day of the Feast, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. ","Gbe e gbe yě ná ɖu xwe ɔ́ fó ɔ́ wɛ nyí azǎn tají.

"Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him.” ","Lě e Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ko ɖɔ gbɔn ɔ́, mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú mì ɔ́, ná húzú tɔjɔtɛn e mɛ sin e nɔ ná gbɛ mɛ ɔ́ nɔ sa sín é.” "
"By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified. ","Yɛsinsɛn e mɛ e ɖi nǔ n'i lɛ́ɛ ná mɔ yí ɔ́ xó ɖɔ wɛ Jezu ɖe. Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, Mawu ko na Yɛsinsɛn mɛɖé ǎ; ɖó Jezu ko byɔ́ susu tɔn mɛ ǎ. "
"On hearing his words, some of the people said, “Surely this man is the Prophet.” ","Mɛ gěgé ɖo agun ɔ́ mɛ, bɔ ée yě se xó énɛ́ ɔ́, yě ɖɔ: “Dandan mɛ ɔ́, nya élɔ́ wɛ nyí gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn.” "
"Others said, “He is the Christ.” Still others asked, “How can the Christ come from Galilee? ","Mɛ ɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Klísu wɛ;” lo ɔ́, mɛ ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ nɔ ɖɔ: “Klísu ɔ́ sixú gosín Galilée ǎ. "
"Does not the Scripture say that the Christ will come from David's family and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?” ","Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ko ɖɔ Davídi ví lɛ́ɛ mɛ wɛ Klísu ɔ́ ɖó ná tɔ́n sín, ɖo Bɛteleyɛ́mu, Davídi tomɛ.” "
Thus the people were divided because of Jesus. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, agun ɔ́ klán gbe ɖó Jezu wútu. "
"Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him. ","Mɛ ɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖo yě mɛ, bo jló ná wlí i; yě mɛ ɖěbǔ sín alɔ ka jɛ wǔ tɔn ǎ. "
"Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, “Why didn't you bring him in?” ","Hwenu sɔ́ja e è sɛ́ dó Jezu wlí gbé lɛ́ɛ lɛ́ kɔ wá ɔ́, vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ kpó kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Étɛ́wú mi ma ka kplá ɛ wá ǎ?” "

“Has any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him? ,Mi mɔ gǎn mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖě abǐ Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ ɖě ɖi nǔ n'i a? 
No! But this mob that knows nothing of the law–there is a curse on them.” ,"Mɛ tobutóbú élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ e ma ka tunwun Mɔyízi sɛ́n ɔ́ ǎ, bo ɖo xwixwedó e wɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, nu wɛ è ko dó yě.” "
"Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked, ",Falizyɛn e ɖo fínɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó nɔ nyí Nikodɛ́mu
“Does our law condemn anyone without first hearing him to find out what he is doing?” ,"“Đo sɛ́n mǐtɔn mɛ ɔ́, e nɔ ɖó hwɛ nú mɛɖé má se xó ɖé ɖo nu tɔn, ma ka tunwun nǔ e é wa nyi do ɔ́ a?” "
"They replied, “Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee.” ",Bɔ yě yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Galiléenu wɛ hwi lɔmɔ̌ nyí a? Kpɔ́n Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ganjí bo! A ná mɔ ɖɔ gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn ɖě kún gosín Galilée ó.” [ 
Then each went to his own home.But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó lɛ́ kɔ yi xwé tɔn gbe.Lo ɔ́, Jezu yi só e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ olívutín só ɔ́ jí. "
"They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. ","Xó énɛ́ e yě kanbyɔ́ Jezu ɔ́, mɔ wɛ nyí bɔ yě ɖó n'i, bo na dó ɖó hwɛ n'i. Jezu ka fɛ, bo jɛ nǔ wlán dó kɔ́ mɛ jí kpódó alɔví kpó. "
"When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.” ","Ée yě ɖo nǔ kanbyɔ́ ɛ wɛ magbokɔ ɔ́, é jlɔ́ kɔ bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mɛ e ɖo mi mɛ bó ma hu hwɛ kpɔ́n gbeɖé ǎ ɔ́ ní nyi awǐnnyaglo dó e jɛ nukɔn.” "
Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. ,"Ée é ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, é lɛ́ vɔ́ fɛ, bó jɛ nǔ wlán dó kɔ́ mɛ jí. "
"At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there.

"Then they hurled insults at him and said, “You are this fellow's disciple! We are disciples of Moses! ","Ée nya ɔ́ ɖɔ mɔ̌ nú yě ɔ́, yě bɔ zun ɖó n'i, bó ɖɔ: “Hwi wɛ nyí ahwanvú dǎwe énɛ́ tɔn, mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, ahwanvú Mɔyízi tɔn wɛ mǐ nyí. "
"We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don't even know where he comes from.” ","Mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ tunwun ɖɔ Mɔyízi wɛ Mawu ɖɔ xó ná; amɔ̌, mɛ énɛ́ ɔ́, mi tunwun fí e éyɛ́ gosín ɔ́ ǎ.” "
"The man answered, “Now that is remarkable! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes. ","Nya ɔ́ ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “É kpácá mì bɔ mi tunwun fí e é gosín ɔ́ ǎ, có é ka hun nukún nú nyɛ. "
We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly man who does his will. ,"Đó mǐ tunwun ganjí ɖɔ Mawu kún nɔ ɖótó hwɛhutɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ó; mɛ e ka nɔ sí Mawu bo nɔ blǒ nǔ e Mawu jlǒ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mɛ énɛ́ ɔ́ wɛ Mawu nɔ ɖótó. "
Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. ,È se gbeɖé kpɔ́n ɖɔ mɛɖé hun nukún nú mɛ e ko tɔ́n nukún sín nɔ tɔn xo mɛ ɔ́ ǎ. 
"If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.” ","Ényí nya énɛ́ ma ka gosín Mawu gɔ́n ǎ ɔ́, é ná sixú wa nǔɖé ǎ.” "
"To this they replied, “You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!” And they threw him out. ","Yě ká yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Hwi ɖésúnɔ bǐ ɔ́, hwɛ mɛ wɛ è ji we dó, bɔ a ka wá ja nǔ kplɔ́n mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ gbé.” Bɔ yě ɖe e sín agun yětɔn mɛ. "
"Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?” ","Ée Jezu se ɖɔ yě ɖe dǎwe e é hun nukún ná ɔ́ sín agun yětɔn mɛ ɔ́, é wá yi kpé e ɖo alixo, bó kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “A ɖi nǔ nú Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ a?” "
"“Who is he, sir?” the man asked. “Tell me so that I may believe in him.” ","Dǎwe ɔ́ ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Mɛɖaxó, mɛ̌ ka nyí mɛ ɔ́, ɖɔ nú mì bónú má ɖi nǔ n'i.” "
"Jesus said, “You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you.” ",Jezu ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Mɛ ɔ́ ɖíe mɔ wɛ a ko ɖe e

"Jesus said, “For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.” ","Jezu ka ɖɔ: “Un wá gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ bó ná ɖe nǔwanyido gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ tɔn nyi wěxo, bónú mɛ e ma mɔ nǔ ǎ lɛ́ɛ ná mɔ nǔ, bónú mɛ e ka ɖo nǔ mɔ wɛ lɛ́ɛ ná húzú nukúntíntɔ́nnɔ.” "
"Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, “What? Are we blind too?” ","Falizyɛn ɖé lɛ́ɛ ka ɖo fínɛ́ xá Jezu, bó se xó énɛ́ ɔ́, bó kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Mǐ lɔmɔ̌ nyí nukúntíntɔ́nnɔ wɛ a?” "
"Jesus said, “If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.“I tell you the truth, the man who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber. ","Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Ényí nukúntíntɔ́nnɔ wɛ mi ko nyí ɔ́, hwɛ mitɔn sɔ́ ná kpo ɖo kɔ nú mi ǎ.

"Jesus used this figure of speech, but they did not understand what he was telling them. ","Lǒ wɛ nyí bɔ Jezu dó bó dó ɖɔ xó nú yě, yě ká mɔ nukúnnú jɛ nǔ e é jlǒ ná ɖɔ nú yě ɔ́ mɛ ǎ. "
"Therefore Jesus said again, “I tell you the truth, I am the gate for the sheep. ",Jezu lɛ́ ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Má ɖɔ nǔgbó nú mi: nyɛ wɛ nyí hɔn nú lɛ̌ngbɔ́ lɛ́ɛ. 
"All who ever came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. ","Mɛ e ko jɛ nukɔn nú mì lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ nyí ajotɔ́ axánsúnxó, lɛ̌ngbɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ka ɖótó yě ǎ. "
"I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. He will come in and go out, and find pasture. ","Nyɛ wɛ nyí hɔn ɔ́. Mɛ e ná gbɔn jǐ ce ɔ́, è nǎ hwlɛ́n ɛ gán; é ná nɔ́ yi, bó ná nɔ́ wá, bó ná nɔ́ mɔ nǔ ɖu. "
"The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full. ","Ajotɔ́ ɔ́, ajogbé wɛ é nɔ́ tɔ́n, bó nɔ́ tɔ́n mɛ hu gbé, bó nɔ́ tɔ́n nǔ hɛn gblé gbé. Nyɛ ɔ́, un wá bónú lɛ̌ngbɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ná mɔ gbɛ, bó mɔ gbɛ dó gbɛ jí. "
“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. ,"“Nyɛ wɛ nyí lɛ̌ngbɔ́nyitɔ́ ɖagbe ɔ́, lɛ̌ngbɔ́nyitɔ́ ɖagbe ɔ́ nɔ́ sɔ́ gbɛ tɔn dó sá vɔ̌ dó lɛ̌ngbɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ tamɛ. "
"The hired hand is not the shepherd who owns the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. ","Azɔ̌watɔ́ e ka ɖo lɛ̌ngbɔ́ lɛ́ɛ nyi wɛ ɖó akwɛ́ kɛ́ɖɛ́ wútu, bɔ lɛ̌ngbɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ma nyí étɔn ǎ ɔ́, ényí é mɔ hla jǎwe ɔ́, hɔn wɛ é nɔ hɔn jó lɛ̌ngbɔ́ lɛ́ɛ dó, bɔ hla nɔ byɔ́ yě mɛ, bó nɔ́ wlí ɖě, bó nɔ́ gba ɖě lɛ́ɛ dó.

The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. ,"Mɛ énɛ́ ɔ́ nɔ hɔn, ɖó akwɛ́ kɛ́ɖɛ́ ba wɛ é ɖe. Lɛ̌ngbɔ́ lɛ́ɛ sín gbɛ nɔ vɛ́ n'i ǎ. "
“I am the good shepherd,Fon
"I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd. ","Un lɛ́ ɖó lɛ̌ngbɔ́ ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ bɔ yě ɖo wutó élɔ́ mɛ ǎ; un ɖó ná kplá yě lɔmɔ̌ wá fí, bɔ yě ná se gbe ce, bɔ lɛ̌ngbɔ́hwan ɔ́ ná nyí ɖokpó, bɔ lɛ̌ngbɔ́nyitɔ́ lɔmɔ̌ ná nyí ɖokpó. "
The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life–only to take it up again. ,"“Tɔ́ ɔ́ yí wǎn nú mì, ɖó un sɔ́ gbɛ ce dó sá vɔ̌ ná, bó ná sixú lɛ́ vɔ́ yí. "
"No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father.” ","Mɛɖěbǔ ná yí gbɛ ce sín así ce ǎ; lo ɔ́, nyɛ ɖésú wɛ jló bó sɔ́ jó; ɖó un ɖó acɛ e sɔ́ gbɛ ce jó é, bó ka lɛ́ ɖó acɛ e lɛ́ vɔ́ yí é.

At these words the Jews were again divided. ,"Gbemanɔkpɔ́ lɛ́ byɔ́ Jwifu e gbɛ́ wǎn nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ mɛ, ɖó xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ wútu. "
"Many of them said, “He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?” ","Bɔ mɛ gěgé ɖo yě mɛ, bó ɖɔ: “Yɛ nyanya wɛ ɖo jǐ tɔn; taɖunɔ wɛ; étɛ́wú mi ka ɖo tó ɖó e wɛ?” "
"But others said, “These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?” ",Mɛ ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Mɛ e jí yɛ nyanya ɖe ɔ́ sín xó ɖiɖɔ nɛ́ ǎ
"Then came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter, ","Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, Jwifu lɛ́ɛ kplé ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu, bó ɖo hwenu e yě sɔ́ sinsɛnxɔ yětɔn dó alɔ mɛ nú Mawu ɔ́ sín xwe ɖu wɛ. Avivɔ ɖaxó hwenu wɛ, "
and Jesus was in the temple area walking in Solomon's Colonnade. ,"bɔ Jezu ɖo sa ɖi wɛ gbɔn Salomɔ́ɔ sín agba jí, ɖo sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́ mɛ. "
"The Jews gathered around him, saying, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.” ","Jwifu e gbɛ́ wǎn nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó e, bó kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Káká jɛ hwetɛ́nu a nǎ ɖɔ xó jɔ xó nú mǐ, bɔ mǐ ná gɔn nǔ xokpɔ́n dó?

"Jesus answered, “I did tell you, but you do not believe. The miracles I do in my Father's name speak for me, ","Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Un ko ɖɔ nú mi, mi ka ɖi ǎ. Nǔ e wa wɛ un ɖe ɖo Tɔ́ ce nyǐkɔ mɛ lɛ́ɛ nɔ ɖe kúnnu nú mì. "
but you do not believe because you are not my sheep. ,"Lo ɔ́ mi ka ɖi ǎ, ɖó mi ɖo lɛ̌ngbɔ́ ce lɛ́ɛ mɛ ǎ. "
"My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. ","Lɛ̌ngbɔ́ ce lɛ́ɛ nɔ ɖótó gbe ce, un tunwun yě bɔ yě nɔ xwedó mì. "
"I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand. ",Un nɔ ná gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ yě
"My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all ; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand. ","Tɔ́ ce e sɔ́ yě dó así nú mì ɔ́, hú gǎn nǔ bǐ, mɛ ɖěbǔ sixú xo nǔɖé yí sín alɔ tɔn mɛ ǎ. "
I and the Father are one.” ,"Nyɛ kpódó Tɔ́ ɔ́ kpó ɔ́, ɖokpó wɛ mǐ nyǐ.” "
"Again the Jews picked up stones to stone him, ","Jwifu e gbɛ́ wǎn nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ fɔ awǐnnyaglo bó ná nyi dó hu i ná, "
"but Jesus said to them, “I have shown you many great miracles from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?” ","bɔ Jezu ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Nǔ ɖagbe e gosín Tɔ́ ce gɔ́n lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, un ɖe gěgé xlɛ́ mi; ɖě tɛ́ wútu wɛ mi jló ná nyi awǐnnyaglo dó hu mì?” "
"“We are not stoning you for any of these,” replied the Jews, “but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God.” ","Yě yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Nǔ ɖagbe e a ɖe xlɛ́ mǐ lɛ́ɛ ɖě wútu wɛ mǐ jló ná nyi awǐnnyaglo dó hu we ǎ, nu e a nylǎ dó Mawu wú ɔ́ wútu wɛ.

"Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your Law, ‘I have said you are gods’ ? ",Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “È ma wlán dó Mawuxówéma mitɔn mɛ ɖɔ: ‘Un ɖɔ jí: mawu wɛ mi nyí’ ǎ cé? 
"If he called them ‘gods,’ to whom the word of God came–and the Scripture cannot be broken– ","Mawuxówéma ɔ́ nɛ́ è ma ka sixú gbídí nǔ ɖěbǔ ɖ'é mɛ ǎ nɛ́. Ényí è ka ylɔ́ mɛ e ɖɔ Mawuxó ná wɛ è ɖe lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ mawu ɔ́, "
"what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, ‘I am God's Son’? ","étɛ́wú nyɛ mɛ e Mawu ka ɖe ɖó vo, bó sɛ́ mì dó gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, un ɖɔ nú mi ɖɔ Mawu ví wɛ un nyí, bɔ mi ka ɖɔ un nylá nu dó Mawu wú? "
Do not believe me unless I do what my Father does. ,"Nú un ma ɖo azɔ̌ e nyí Tɔ́ ce tɔn lɛ́ɛ wa wɛ ǎ hǔn, mi ma ɖi nǔ nú mì ó. "
"But if I do it, even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.” ","Ényí un ka ɖo azɔ̌ e nyí étɔn lɛ́ɛ wa wɛ hǔn, mi na bo ma ɖi nǔ nú mì ǎ hǔn, mi bo ɖi nǔ ɖó azɔ̌ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ wútu.

"Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped their grasp. ","Ée Jezu ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě lɛ́ jló ná wlí i, bɔ é ka hɔn sín yě mɛ. "
Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing in the early days. Here he stayed ,"É lɛ́ yi Judɛ́ɛn tɔ gúdo, fí e Jǎan lɛ yɛhwesin nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖe ɔ́, bó cí fínɛ́. "
"and many people came to him. They said, “Though John never performed a miraculous sign, all that John said about this man was true.” ","Gbɛtɔ́ gěgé wá gɔ̌n tɔn bó nɔ́ ɖɔ: “Jǎan Yɛhwesinlɛnúmɛtɔ́ jlɛ́ nǔ ɖěbǔ ǎ; lo ɔ́, nǔ e é ka ɖɔ dó nya élɔ́ wú ɔ́ bǐ wɛ nyí nǔgbó.” "
"And in that place many believed in Jesus.Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. ","Bɔ fínɛ́ ɔ́, mɛ gěgé ɖi nǔ nú Jezu.Nya ɖé tíin, bó ɖo azɔn jɛ wɛ, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Lazáa Betaníi tɔn; Betaníi ɔ́, Mali kpódó nɔví tɔn Maati kpó sín gletoxo wɛ. "
"This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair. ","Mali énɛ́ wɛ nyí nyɔ̌nu e sá célu nú Jezu, bó zé ɖa tɔn dó súnsún afɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ ná é; nɔví tɔn wɛ ka nyí Lazáa e ɖo azɔn jɛ wɛ é. "
"So the sisters sent word to Jesus, “Lord, the one you love is sick.” ","Lazáa sín nɔví nyɔ̌nu we lɛ́ɛ ka sɛ́ wɛn dó Jezu bó ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ, xɔ́ntɔn towe vívɛ́ná ɔ́ ɖo azɔn jɛ wɛ.” "
"When he heard this, Jesus said, “This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it.” ","Ée Jezu se mɔ̌ ɔ́, é ɖɔ jí: “Kú wɛ ná ɖu ɖo azɔn élɔ́ jí ǎ; é ná ɖe susu Mawu tɔn xlɛ́, bɔ Mawu ví ɔ́ ná xɔ susu gbɔn gbla tɔn mɛ.” "
Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. ,"Jezu ka yí wǎn nú Maati kpódó nɔví tɔn nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ kpó, kpódó Lazáa kpán. "
"Yet when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days. ","Lo ɔ́, hwenu e Jezu se ɖɔ Lazáa ɖo azɔn jɛ wɛ ɔ́, é lɛ́ nɔ to e mɛ é ɖe ɔ́ nú azǎn we d'é jí. "
"Then he said to his disciples, “Let us go back to Judea.” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, é wá ɖɔ nú ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Mi nú mǐ ná lɛ́ kɔ yi Judée.” "
"“But Rabbi,” they said, “a short while ago the Jews tried to stone you, and yet you are going back there?” ","Ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌si, ayisɔnmɔ tófí jɛ́n wɛ Judéenu lɛ́ɛ ja huhu we gbé kpódó awǐnnyaglo kpó ɖo dɔ̌n, bɔ a nǎ lɛ́ lɛ́ kɔ yi dɔ̌n a?” "
"Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? A man who walks by day will not stumble, for he sees by this world's light. ","Jezu ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Ganxixo wěwe wɛ ɖo kéze ɖokpó mɛ; ényí mɛɖé ɖo yiyi wɛ kéze ɔ́, é nɔ klɛ́n afɔ ǎ, ɖó gbɛ mɛ nɔ za wě. "
"It is when he walks by night that he stumbles, for he has no light.” ","É ka nyí zǎn mɛ wɛ é ɖo yiyi wɛ ɔ́, é nɔ klɛ́n afɔ, ɖó wěziza ɖo é ɖésúnɔ mɛ ǎ.” "
"After he had said this, he went on to tell them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up.” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, é lɛ́ ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Xɔ́ntɔn mǐtɔn Lazáa ɖo amlɔ dɔ́ wɛ; un ná yi fɔ́n ɛ.” "
"His disciples replied, “Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better.” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kɛ nu bo ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ, ényí ɖɔ amlɔ dɔ́ wɛ jɛ́n é ɖe ɔ́, azɔn tɔn ná gbɔ.” "
"Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep. ","Lazáa ko kú ɖɔ nú yě wɛ Jezu ɖe, cóbɔ yědɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ka vɛdó ɖɔ amlɔ dɔ́ wɛ é ɖe, bó ɖo gbigbɔ jɛ wɛ sín. "
"So then he told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead, ",Bɔ Jezu gbɔ bo ɖɔ nyi wɛn nú yě ɖɔ: “Lazáa kú
"and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.” ",fínɛ́ e un ma ka ɖe cóbɔ é kú ǎ ɔ́ víví nú mì ɖó mi wútu
"Then Thomas (called Didymus) said to the rest of the disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with him.” ","Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, Tɔmáa e è nɔ lɛ́ ylɔ́ ɖɔ hǒxo ɔ́ ɖɔ nú ahwanvú ɖě lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Mi nú mǐ lɔmɔ̌ ná xwedó e hɛn yi, bó ná yi kú xá ɛ.” "
"On his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days. ","Ée Jezu wá Betaníi ɔ́, é mɔ ɖɔ è ko ɖi Lazáa, bɔ azǎn tɔn ko yi ɛnɛ. "
"Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem, ",Betaníi yá dó Jeluzalɛ́mu bó ɖo kilomɛ́tlu atɔn mɔ̌ dó e. 
and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother. ,Bɔ Judéenu lɛ́ɛ gěgé ko wá nǔwamɛgbe dó Maati kpódó Mali kpó gbé ɖó nɔví yětɔn e kú ɔ́ wú. 
"When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home. ","Ée Maati se ɖɔ Jezu jǎwe ɔ́, é yi kpé e ɖo alixo; lo ɔ́, Mali cí xwé gbe. "
"“Lord,” Martha said to Jesus, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died. ","Ée Maati yi mɔ Jezu ɔ́, é ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ, ényí fí wɛ a ko ɖe ɔ́, nɔví ce ná kú ǎ. "
But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask.” ,"Có din ɖésú ɔ́, un tunwun ɖɔ a byɔ́ nǔ ɖěbǔ Mawu ɔ́, é ná ná bǐ we.” "
"Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.” ",Jezu ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Nɔví towe ná fɔ́n.” 
"Martha answered, “I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.” ","Bɔ Maati yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Un tunwun ɖɔ é ná fɔ́n ɖo fínfɔ́n sín kú mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ tɔn hwenu, ɖo azǎn gǔdo gúdo tɔn ɔ́ gbe.” "
"Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; ","Jezu ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Nyɛ wɛ nyí fínfɔ́n sín kú, bo lɛ́ nyí gbɛ; mɛ ɖěbǔ ɖi nǔ nú mì ɔ́, é ná bo kú ɔ́, é ná nɔ gbɛ. "
and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?” ,Mɛ e ka ɖo gbɛ bo ɖi nǔ nú mì ɔ́ ná kú gbeɖé ǎ. A ɖi nǔ ɖɔ nǔ ná nyí mɔ̌ a?” 
"“Yes, Lord,” she told him, “I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.” ","Maati ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Ɛɛn Aklúnɔ, un ɖi nǔ ɖɔ hwi wɛ nyí Klísu Mawu ví e ɖó ná wá gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ é.” "
"And after she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. “The Teacher is here,” she said, “and is asking for you.” ","Ée Maati ná xósin énɛ́ ɔ́ Jezu ɔ́, é yi ylɔ́ nɔví tɔn Mali bó ɖe kpá ɛ ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌si wá bo ɖo ylɔ̌ylɔ́ we wɛ.” "
"When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him. ","Ée Mali se mɔ̌ ɔ́, é sí te vawun, bo ɖidó Jezu kpé gbé. "
"Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him. ","Jezu ko byɔ́ gletoxo ɔ́ mɛ hwenɛ́nu ǎ, é kpo ɖo fí e Maati yi kpé e ɖe é. "
"When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there. ","Ée Judéenu e wá bo ɖo xwé ɔ́ gbé xá Mali, bo ɖo gbɔ dó n'i wɛ lɛ́ɛ mɔ bɔ é sí te vawun mɔ̌ bo tɔ́n ɔ́, yě xwedó e, ɖó yě vɛdó ɖɔ yɔ ɔ́ jí ya avǐ ɖe gbé wɛ é xwe sín. "
"When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.” ","Ée Mali yi mɔ Jezu ɖo fí e é ɖe ɔ́, é jɛ kpo ɖo nukɔn tɔn, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ, ényí a ko ɖo fí wɛ ɔ́, nɔví ce ná kú ǎ.” "
"When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. ","Ée Jezu mɔ ɖɔ é ɖo avǐ ya wɛ, bɔ Judéenu e xwedó e lɛ́ɛ lɔ ɖo avǐ ya wɛ ɔ́, lanmɛ tɔn slɔ́ fún, bɔ ayi tɔn bǐ gbadó; "

Jesus wept. ,Bɔ Jezu ya avǐ. 
"Then the Jews said, “See how he loved him!” ","Ée Judéenu lɛ́ɛ mɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě ɖɔ: “Mi kpɔ́n lě e é yí wǎn n'i sɔ é.” "
"But some of them said, “Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?” ","Mɛ ɖé lɛ́ɛ ka ɖo yě mɛ bó ɖɔ: “Éyɛ́ mɛ e hun nukún nú nukúntíntɔ́nnɔ ɔ́, é sixú bló bónú nya énɛ́ gɔn kúkú ǎ cé?” "
"Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance. ","Wǔ lɛ́ kú Jezu, bɔ é ɖidó yɔdo ɔ́ kɔn; yɔdo ɖé wɛ bó ɖo sóxo mɛ bɔ è blǐ awǐnnya nyi nu. "

"Then Jesus said, “Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?” ","Jezu ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Un ko ɖɔ nú we ɖɔ nú a ɖi nǔ ɔ́, a ná mɔ susu Mawu tɔn ǎ cé?” "
"So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, “Father, I thank you that you have heard me. ","Bɔ yě blí awǐnnya ɔ́ síin. Jezu ka zé ta yi jǐ, bó ɖɔ: “Tɔ́ ce, un dó kú nú we, ɖó a ɖǒtó mì. "
"I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me.” ","Un tunwun ɖɔ a nɔ ɖótó mì tɛgbɛ; amɔ̌, mɛ e lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó mì lɛ́ɛ wútu wɛ un ka ɖo xó ɖɔ wɛ bónú yě ná dó ɖi nǔ ɖɔ hwi wɛ sɛ́ mì dó.” "
"When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!” ","Ée Jezu ɖɔ xó énɛ́ vɔ ɔ́, é sú xó syɛ́nsyɛ́n bo ɖɔ: “Lazáa tɔ́n, bó wá.” "
"The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, “Take off the grave clothes and let him go.” ","Bɔ mɛkúkú ɔ́ tɔ́n sín yɔdo ɔ́ mɛ nǔgbó, bɔ avɔ e è lɛ̌ dó afɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpódó alɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpán é bǐ ɖo mɔ̌, bɔ avɔ e è dǒ blǎ gba n'i ɔ́ ɖo nukún mɛ n'i. Jezu ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi tún gba n'i, bo jó e dó nú é yi.” "
"Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him. ","Ée Judéenu e wá Mali gɔ́n lɛ́ɛ mɔ nǔ énɛ́ e Jezu jlɛ́ ɔ́, yě mɛ gěgé ɖi nǔ n'i. "
But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. ,"Nǔ ɖo mɔ̌ có mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖo yě mɛ, bó yi mɔ Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ, bó wlí nǔ e Jezu wa é bǐ ɖɔ nú yě. "
Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. “What are we accomplishing?” they asked. “Here is this man performing many miraculous signs. ,"Bɔ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ kpó ylɔ́ kplé toxóɖɔtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ tɔn, bó ɖɔ: “Nɛ̌ mǐ ká ná bló gbɔn nú nya élɔ́?

"If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.” ","Ényí mǐ jó e dó, bɔ é ɖo nǔ wa gbɔn mɔ̌ wɛ ɔ́, mɛ bǐ ná ɖi nǔ n'i, bɔ Hlɔ̌manu lɛ́ɛ ná wá gba sinsɛnxɔ mǐtɔn, bó ná gba to ɔ́ dó ta nú mǐ.” "
"Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, “You know nothing at all! ","Mɛ ɖokpó ka ɖo yě mɛ, bó nɔ́ nyí Kayífu; é wɛ ɖo vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó sín azɔ̌ wa wɛ xwe énɛ́ xwe, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi tunwun nǔɖé ǎ. "
You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.” ,"Hǔn mi mɔ ɖɔ mɛ ɖokpó géé kú dó mɛ bǐ tamɛ ɔ́, é nyɔ́ hú to ɔ́ bǐ sésé ní vɔ ǎ cé?” "
"He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, ","É ɖésú wɛ ka ɖo xó énɛ́ ɖɔ wɛ ǎ; lo ɔ́, xwe énɛ́ xwe ɔ́, é wɛ nyí vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó ɔ́, bɔ Mawu ɖɔ xó gbɔn jǐ tɔn ɖɔ Jezu ná kú dó togun ɔ́ bǐ tamɛ. "
"and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one. ",É ka nyí ɖɔ togun énɛ́ ɔ́ kɛ́ɖɛ́ tamɛ wɛ é ná kú dó ǎ
So from that day on they plotted to take his life. ,Sín gbe énɛ́ gbe ɖokpóó wɛ yě ko ɖe gbeta tɔ́n ɖɔ émí ná hu i. 
"Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the Jews. Instead he withdrew to a region near the desert, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wútu wɛ Jezu sɔ́ nɔ zé éɖée xlɛ́ Judéenu lɛ́ɛ agbawungba ǎ, bɔ é kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó yi cí to e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Eflayímu é mɛ, ɖo malín málín mɛ dó gbětótló mɛ. "
"When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover. ","Dǐndínwáyixwe Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn ko sɛ yá; bɔ to ɔ́ mɛ nu lɛ́ɛ gěgé ko yi Jeluzalɛ́mu bó ná yi slá wǔ, cóbɔ xwe ɔ́ ná wá. "
"They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple area they asked one another, “What do you think? Isn't he coming to the Feast at all?” ","Yě ɖo Jezu ba wɛ, bó jɛ kinkanbyɔ́ yěɖée jí ɖo sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́ mɛ ɖɔ: “É ná wá xwe ɔ́ tɛnmɛ ǎ wɛ a? Étɛ́ mi ka mɔ dó nǔ énɛ́ wú?” "
"But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone found out where Jesus was, he should report it so that they might arrest him.Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived at Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. ","Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ kpó ɖé gbeta tɔn, bó ɖɔ: “Ényí mɛ ɖěbǔ tunwun fí e é ɖe ɔ́ hǔn, ní wá ɖɔ, bónú è nǎ yi wlí i.”Dǐndínwáyixwe kpo azǎn ayizɛ́n, bɔ Jezu yi Betaníi fí e Lazáa e é fɔ́n sín kú ɔ́ nɔ́ nɔ é. "
"Here a dinner was given in Jesus' honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him. ","Ée é yi fínɛ́ ɔ́, yě ná nǔɖuɖu i, bɔ é kpódó Lazáa kpó ɖo ɖuɖu wɛ, bɔ Maati ɖo ká sɛn wɛ. "
"Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. ","Mali ka sɔ́ célu axivɛ́nu lǐtli vlɔ́, bɔ è sɔ́ nǎ akú dó bló ná, lobo kɔn dó afɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ jí, bó dɔn ɖa tɔn dó súnsún ná, bɔ célu ɔ́ sín wǎn gba kpé xwé ɔ́ gbe bǐ. "
"But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected, ",Jezu sín ahwanvú Judási Isikaliɔ́ti e ɖo nǎ sa ɛ wɛ ɔ́ ɖɔ: 
“Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year's wages. ” ,"“Étɛ́wú è ma ka sixú sɔ́ célu énɛ́ e è nǎ mɔ gankwɛ́ afɔɖé kanwe ko (250) cóbó xɔ ɔ́ sɔ́ sa, bó má akwɛ́ tɔn nú wamamɔnɔ lɛ́ɛ ǎ?” "
"He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it. ","É ka nyí ɖɔ wamamɔnɔ lɛ́ɛ sín kan vɛ́ wɛ é ɖe, bo ɖɔ mɔ̌ ǎ; lo ɔ́, ajotɔ́ wɛ n'i, ɖó é wɛ nɔ hɛn akwɛ́ yětɔn, bó nɔ ɖo finfin ɖ'é mɛ wɛ. "
"“Leave her alone,” Jesus replied. “It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial. ",Jezu ka ɖɔ: “Mi jó nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ dó ní hɛn nǔ e é ɖó ɔ́ nú gbe e gbe è nǎ ɖi mì é. 
"You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.” ","Midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, wamamɔnɔ lɛ́ɛ ɖo mi mɛ tɛgbɛ; nyɛ ka ɖo mi mɛ tɛgbɛ ǎ.” "
"Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. ","Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, Judéenu lɛ́ɛ gěgé se ɖɔ Jezu ɖo Betaníi, bó nyi ahwan ɖidó dɔ̌n; é ka nyí Jezu kɛ́ɖɛ́ gbé wɛ yě tɔ́n ǎ, lo ɔ́, yě jló ná yi kpɔ́n Lazáa e é fɔ́n sín kú ɔ́ lɔ. "
"So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, ","Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ ka ɖe gbeta tɔ́n, bó ná hu Lazáa lɔmɔ̌, "
for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and putting their faith in him. ,"ɖó éyɛ́ wútu wɛ Judéenu lɛ́ɛ gěgé jó vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán yětɔn lɛ́ɛ dó, bó ɖi nǔ nú Jezu. "
The next day the great crowd that had come for the Feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. ,"Ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn ɔ́, yě mɛ wɔ̌buwɔ́bú e wá xwe ɖu gbé ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu lɛ́ɛ se ɖɔ Jezu ja fínɛ́; "
"They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, “Hosanna! ” “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!” “Blessed is the King of Israel!” ","bɔ yě ba děma hɛn alɔ mɛ, bo ɖo xó sú wɛ káká bo yi kpé e; bo nɔ ɖɔ: “Ozána! Susu nú Mawu! Susu nú mɛ e jǎwe ɖo Aklúnɔ nyǐkɔ mɛ é: susu nú axɔ́sú Izlayɛ́li tɔn.” "
"Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written, ","Jezu mɔ tócíví ɖokpó bó jínjɔ́n jí, lě e è ko wlán dó Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ gbɔn ɔ́ ɖɔ: "
"“Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a donkey's colt.” ","“Mi ma ɖi xɛsi ó Sinyɔ́ɔnu lɛ́ɛ mi, axɔ́sú mitɔn ɖíe jǎwe bó jínjɔ́n tócíví jí e!” "
At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him. ,"Ahwanvú Jezu tɔn lɛ́ɛ ka yá wǔ mɔ nǔ jɛ nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ e ɖo jijɛ wɛ lɛ́ɛ mɛ ǎ; lo ɔ́, hwenu e è sɔ́ Jezu su ɔ́, yě flín ɖɔ nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ e jɛ ɔ́ bǐ wɛ è ko wlán dó wú tɔn ɖ'ayǐ nǔgbó. "
Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word. ,"Mɛ e ɖo te hwenu e Jezu ylɔ́ Lazáa sín yɔdo mɛ, bo fɔ́n ɛ sín kú ɔ́ ɖɔ nǔ e yě mɔ ɔ́. "
"Many people, because they had heard that he had given this miraculous sign, went out to meet him. ","Nǔ énɛ́ wútu wɛ mɛ lɛ́ɛ nyi ahwan wá kpé e, ɖó yě se ɖɔ é jlɛ́ nǔ mɔ̌hun. "
"So the Pharisees said to one another, “See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!” ",Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ ka jɛ ɖiɖɔ jí ɖo yěɖée tɛ́ntin ɖɔ: “Mi ma mɔ din ɖɔ mǐ kún sixú ɖo nǔ ɖěbǔ wú na kpé wɛ ó a? Énɛ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɖo xwixwedó e wɛ nɛ́!” 
Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast. ,Glɛ̌sinu ɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖo mɛ e wá Mawu sɛn gbé ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu xwe ɔ́ hwenu lɛ́ɛ mɛ. 
"They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. “Sir,” they said, “we would like to see Jesus.” ","Yě yi mɔ Filípu e gosín Bɛtisayida ɖo Galilée yíkúngban jí ɔ́, bo ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Mɛɖaxó, mǐ jló ná mɔ Jezu.” "
Philip went to tell Andrew,Fon
"Jesus replied, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. ",Jezu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Hwenu e è nǎ sɔ́ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ su ɔ́ sín gan ɖíe xo lo e. 
"I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. ","Ma ɖɔ nǔgbó nú mi, ényí jinukún má yi do bó kú ǎ ɔ́, é nɔ ná nǔkún ǎ; kú wɛ é nɔ́ kú, cóbó nɔ gba kún. "
"The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. ","Mɛ e yí wǎn nú gbɛ éɖée tɔn ɔ́, gbɛ tɔn ná bú dó e; mɛ e ka gbɛ́ wǎn nú gbɛ éɖée tɔn ɖo gbɛ mɛ fí ɔ́ ná hɛn gbɛ tɔn ɖ'ayǐ nú gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ. "
"Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me. ","Mɛ ɖé jló ná nyí mɛsɛntɔ́ ce hǔn, mɛ ɔ́ ní xwedó mì, bɔ fí e un ná nɔ ɔ́ wɛ é lɔmɔ̌ ná nɔ. Ényí mɛɖé nyí mɛsɛntɔ́ ce ɔ́, Tɔ́ ce ná sɔ́ mɛ ɔ́ su.” "
"“Now my heart is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this hour’? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour. ","Jezu ɖɔ: “Din ɔ́, ayi ce bǐ wɛ gbadó.

"Father, glorify your name!” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.” ","Hǔn Daá, bo sɔ́ nyǐkɔ towe su.” Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, gbe ɖé ka ɖi sín jǐxwé, bó ɖɔ: “Un ko sɔ́ nyǐkɔ ce sɔ́ su; un ka ná lɛ́ sɔ́ ɛ su.” "
The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered,Fon
"Jesus said, “This voice was for your benefit, not mine. ",Jezu ka yí xó bo ɖɔ: “Nyɛ wú wɛ gbe énɛ́ ɖi ǎ
Now is the time for judgment on this world,Fon
"But I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.” ","Hwenu e è nǎ sɔ́ mì sín ayǐkúngban jí dó jǐ ɔ́, un ná dɔn gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ dó wǔ.” "
He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die. ,Kú alɔkpa e kú gbé Jezu ja ɔ́ xó ɖɔ wɛ é ɖe. 
"The crowd spoke up, “We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever, so how can you say, ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up’? Who is this ‘Son of Man’?” ","Mɛ lɛ́ɛ ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Mǐ xa ɖo Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ɖɔ Klísu ɔ́ kún ná kú gbeɖé ó, bɔ hwɛ ka ɖo ɖiɖɔ nú mǐ wɛ din ɖɔ è nǎ sɔ́ Gbɛtɔ́ví ɔ́ dó jǐ. Mɛ̌ ká nyí Gbɛtɔ́ví énɛ́?” "
"Then Jesus told them, “You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going. ","Jezu ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Wěziza kpo ɖo mi tɛ́ntin nú hwenu kpɛɖé; mi ɖi zɔnlin hwenu e wěziza kpo ɖo mi tɛ́ntin é, bónú zǐnflú má wá fyán mi ó; ɖó mɛ e ɖo zɔnlin ɖi wɛ ɖo zǐnflú mɛ ɔ́ tunwun fí e é xwe ɔ́ ǎ. "
"Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light.” When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them. ","Hǔn, din e wěziza ɔ́ kpo ɖo te nú mi ɔ́, mi bo ɖi nǔ n'i, bó ná húzú wěziza gbɛtɔ́.” Ée Jezu ɖɔ xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ gúdo ɔ́, é gosín fínɛ́, bó sɔ́ éɖée hwlá dó yě. "
"Even after Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him. ","Jezu jlɛ́ nǔ tobutóbú énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖo nukún yětɔn mɛ, có yě ká ɖi nǔ n'i ǎ; "
"This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: “Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?” ","bónú xó e Mawu ko ɖɔ ɖ'ayǐ gbɔn gbeyíɖɔ tɔn Ezayíi jí ɔ́ ná dó jɛ; é wɛ nyí ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ, mɛ̌ ka ɖi nǔ nú xó e mǐ ɖɔ lɛ́ɛ? Mɛ̌ Aklúnɔ ka ɖe hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n tɔn xlɛ́?” "
"For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere: ","Yě sixú ɖi nǔ nǔgbó ǎ, ɖó Ezayíi lɛ́ ɖɔ: "
"“He has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn–and I would heal them.” ","“Mawu va nukún yě, nú yě má mɔ nukúnnú ó; é cyɔ́n nǔ ayi yětɔn jí, nú yě ma mɔ nukúnnú jɛ nǔ mɛ ó. Mawu ɖɔ: ‘Un bló mɔ̌, bónú yě ma lɛ́ kɔ wá gɔ̌n ce nú má gbɔ azɔn nú yě ó.’ ” "
Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him. ,"Ezayíi ɖɔ xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ, ɖó é mɔ susu e Jezu ɖó é, bó ɖɔ xó dó wǔ tɔn. "
Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not confess their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue,Fon
for they loved praise from men more than praise from God. ,Đó susu xɔ ɖo gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ gɔ́n myá nukún nú yě hú susu xɔ ɖo Mawu gɔ́n. 
"Then Jesus cried out, “When a man believes in me, he does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me. ","Jezu zé gbe yi jǐ, bo ɖɔ: “Mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú mì ɔ́, nyɛ kɛ́ɖɛ́ wɛ é ɖi nǔ ná ǎ; é lɛ́ ɖi nǔ nú mɛ e sɛ́ mì dó é. "
"When he looks at me, he sees the one who sent me. ","Mɛ e mɔ mì ɔ́, mɔ mɛ e sɛ́ mì dó ɔ́ lɔmɔ̌. "
"I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness. ","Nyɛ ɔ́, un wá gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ wěziza ɖɔhun, bónú mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú mì ɔ́ ma nɔ zǐnflú mɛ ó. "
"“As for the person who hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save it. ","Ényí mɛɖé se xó ce, bó ma bló ɖ'é jí ǎ ɔ́, nyɛ wɛ ná ɖó hwɛ n'i ǎ, ɖó un tɔ́n hwɛ ɖó nú mɛ gbé bó wá gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ ǎ; gbɛ ɔ́ hwlɛngán gbé wɛ un ja bó wá. "
There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words,Fon
"For I did not speak of my own accord, but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it. ","Đó nyɛ ɖésúnɔ sín acɛ mɛ ɖɔ xó dó wɛ un ɖe ǎ; lo ɔ́, nǔ e Tɔ́ e sɛ́ mì dó ɔ́ zɔ́n ɖiɖɔ mì ɔ́ ɖɔ wɛ un ɖe. "
"I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say.”It was just before the Passover Feast. Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love. ","Un ka tunwun ɖɔ nǔ e Tɔ́ e sɛ́ mì dó ɔ́ zɔ́n ɔ́ nɔ ná gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ.

"The evening meal was being served, and the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus. ","Jezu kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó ɖo gbada nǔɖuɖu ɖu wɛ. Awǒvi ka ko sɔ́ linlin nyanya dó ayi mɛ nú Judási Sinmɔ́ɔ Isikaliɔ́ti ví ɔ́, ɖɔ ní sa Jezu. "
"Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God; ","Ée Jezu ka tunwun ɖɔ Mawu ko sɔ́ nǔ bǐ dó alɔ mɛ nú émí, bɔ gɔ̌n tɔn wɛ e mi gosín, bó ka lɛ́ lɛ́ kɔ xwe gɔ̌n tɔn ɔ́, "

"“No,” said Peter, “you shall never wash my feet.” Jesus answered, “Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.” ","Piyɛ́ɛ lɛ́ ɖɔ nú Jezu ɖɔ: “A nǎ klɔ́ afɔ nú mì gbeɖé ǎ!” Bɔ Jezu ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Ényí un ma klɔ́ afɔ nú we ǎ ɔ́, hǔn a sɔ́ nyí ahwanvú ce ǎ.” "

"Jesus answered, “A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you.” ","Jezu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Mɛ e ko lɛ wǔ ɔ́, afɔ kɛ́ɖɛ́ jɛ́n kpo n'i bɔ é ná klɔ́, bó ná mɛ́; ɖó mǐmɛ́ jí wɛ mi ko ɖe; amɔ̌ mi bǐ ka wɛ ǎ.” "
"For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean. ","Jezu ɖɔ mɔ̌, ɖó é ko tunwun mɛ e ɖo nǎ sa ɛ ɖu wɛ ɖo yě mɛ é; nǔ e wú é ɖɔ é kún nyí yě bǐ wɛ nyí mɛ mímɛ́ ó ɔ́ nɛ́. "
"When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. “Do you understand what I have done for you?” he asked them.

"“I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart!

"I have made you known to them, and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them.”When he had finished praying, Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was an olive grove, and he and his disciples went into it. ","Un ɖe we xlɛ́ yě, bó ka ná lɛ́ ɖe we xlɛ́ hú mɔ̌, bónú wǎn yíyí e a ɖǒ nú mì ɔ́ ní nɔ yě mɛ, bónú nyɛ ɖésú ná nɔ yě mɛ.”Ée Jezu sa vo énɛ́ ɔ́ nú tɔ́ tɔn gúdo ɔ́, éyɛ́ kpódó ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó dó asá Sedlɔ́n tɔ ɔ́ jɛ agě ɖě ɔ́ jí.

"When Jesus said, “I am he,” they drew back and fell to the ground. ","Ée Jezu yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ nyɛ wɛ ɔ́, yě bǐ j'agɔ yi gúdo, bó yi jɛ ayǐ. "
"Again he asked them, “Who is it you want?” And they said, “Jesus of Nazareth.” ",Jezu lɛ́ kanbyɔ́ yě azɔn wegɔ́ ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌ ba wɛ mi ka ɖe?” Bɔ yě lɛ́ yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Jezu Nazalɛ́tinu ɔ́ ba wɛ mǐ ɖe.”

"Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus.

"When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby struck him in the face. “Is this the way you answer the high priest?” he demanded. ","Ée Jezu ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, sinsɛnxɔcɔ́tɔ́ ɖokpó ɖo fínɛ́, bó xo tó mɛ n'i, bó ɖɔ: “Mɔ̌ wɛ a nǎ yí gbe nú vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó ɔ́ gbɔn a?” "
"“If I said something wrong,” Jesus replied, “testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?” ","Jezu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Ényí nǔ wɛ un ɖɔ nyi do hǔn, ɖe nǔ e un ɖɔ nyi do ɔ́ xlɛ́; é ka nyí xó ganjí wɛ un ɖɔ ɔ́, étɛ́wú a ka xo tó mɛ nú mì?” "
"Then Annas sent him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest. ","Jezu ɖo blǎblá mɔ̌, bɔ Hanna nyi i sɛ́ dó Kayífu vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó ɔ́ gɔ́n. "
"As Simon Peter stood warming himself, he was asked, “You are not one of his disciples, are you?” He denied it, saying, “I am not.” ","Sinmɔ́ɔ Piyɛ́ɛ ɖo te, bó ɖo myɔ xú wɛ ɖo fínɛ́, bɔ yě kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Hwi lɔmɔ̌ má ɖo ahwanvú nya énɛ́ tɔn mɛ ǎ cé?” É ka gbɛ́, bó ɖɔ: “Éeǒ, nyɛ ɖo yě mɛ ɖě ǎ!” "
"One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, “Didn't I see you with him in the olive grove?” ",Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó ɔ́ sín mɛsɛntɔ́ e Piyɛ́ɛ kpa tó ná ɔ́ sín mɛ ɖokpó kanbyɔ́ Piyɛ́ɛ ɖɔ jí: “Un ma mɔ hwi kpó nya énɛ́ kpó ɖo jikpá ɔ́ mɛ a?” 
"Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow. ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka lɛ́ gbɛ́, bɔ tlóló ɔ́, kokló kɔ́ así. "
"Then the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness the Jews did not enter the palace; they wanted to be able to eat the Passover. ","Yě kplá Jezu sín Kayífu xwé, bó kplá ɛ hɛn yi tokpɔngán Hlɔ̌manu lɛ́ɛ tɔn sín hɔnmɛ zǎnzǎn tɛɛn. Lo ɔ́, Jwifu lɛ́ɛ byɔ́ hɔn ɔ́ mɛ ǎ, ɖó yě táá wá ɖu su, bónú xwe ɖuɖu ná gló yě. "
"So Pilate came out to them and asked, “What charges are you bringing against this man?” ","Énɛ́ wú wɛ Pilátu gbɔ bo tɔ́n, bó wá mɔ yě, bó kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Hwɛ tɛ́ dó nya élɔ́ wɛ mi ka ɖe?” "
"“If he were not a criminal,” they replied, “we would not have handed him over to you.” ","Yě yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “É ma ko nyí nǔnyanyawatɔ́ ǎ ɔ́, mǐ ná kplá ɛ wá nú we ǎ.” "
"Pilate said, “Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.” “But we have no right to execute anyone,” the Jews objected. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, Pilátu ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi ɖésúnɔ mi bo kplá ɛ, bó ɖɔ hwɛ xá ɛ lě e sɛ́n mitɔn jló gbɔn é.” Jwifugán lɛ́ɛ ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ jí: “Mǐ ɖó acɛ e hu mɛ é ǎ.” "
This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken indicating the kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled. ,"Nǔ cí mɔ̌, bónú xó e Jezu ɖésú ko ɖɔ ɖ'ayǐ dó kú alɔkpa e é ná kú é wú ɔ́ ná dó jɛ. "
"Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” ","Pilátu ka lɛ́ kɔ yi hɔn ɔ́ mɛ, bó ylɔ́ Jezu, bó kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Hwi wɛ nyí Jwifu lɛ́ɛ sín axɔ́sú ɔ́ a?” "
"“Is that your own idea,” Jesus asked, “or did others talk to you about me?” ","Jezu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Xó énɛ́ e a kanbyɔ́ mì ɔ́, hwi ɖésúnɔ sín xomɛ wɛ é tɔ́n sín a, abǐ mɛ ɖěvo wɛ ɖɔ xó ce nú we?” "
“Am I a Jew?” Pilate replied. “It was your people and your chief priests who handed you over to me. What is it you have done?” ,"Pilátu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Nyɛ ɔ́, Jwifu wɛ un nyí a? To towe mɛ nu lɛ́ɛ kpódó vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpó wɛ kplá we wá nú mì. Étɛ́ a ka wa?” "
"Jesus said, “My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But now my kingdom is from another place.” ","Jezu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Axɔ́súɖuɖu ce nyí gbɛ mɛ fí tɔn ǎ; ényí gbɛ mɛ fí tɔn wɛ é ko nyí ɔ́, ahwanvú ce lɛ́ɛ ná ko fun ahwan, nú è ma jó mì nú Jwifugán lɛ́ɛ ó; axɔ́súɖuɖu ce ka nyí gbɛ mɛ fí tɔn ǎ.” "
"“You are a king, then!” said Pilate. Jesus answered, “You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.” ","Pilátu lɛ́ kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Hǔn axɔ́sú wɛ a nyí nɛ́ hǔn?” Bɔ Jezu yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Hwi wɛ ɖɔ un nyí axɔ́sú.

"“What is truth?” Pilate asked. With this he went out again to the Jews and said, “I find no basis for a charge against him. ","Pilátu kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Ani ka nyí nǔgbó ɔ́?” Ée Pilátu kan mɔ̌ byɔ́ Jezu ɔ́, é lɛ́ tɔ́n, bó yi ɖɔ nú Jwifu e gbɛ́ wǎn nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Un mɔ nǔ e wú un ná ɖó hwɛ nú nya élɔ́ é ɖě ǎ. "
But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release ‘the king of the Jews’?” ,"Lo ɔ́, walɔ mitɔn wɛ é ko nyí, bɔ un nɔ jó gantɔ́ ɖokpó nú mi Dǐndínwáyixwe ɔ́ hwenu. Mi jló nú má jó Jwifu lɛ́ɛ xɔ́sú ɔ́ nú mi a?” "
"They shouted back, “No, not him! Give us Barabbas!” Now Barabbas had taken part in a rebellion.Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. ","Yě bǐ ka sú xó, bó ɖɔ jí: “Gbeɖé, é wɛ a nǎ jǒ nú mǐ ǎ, Balabási wɛ a nǎ jó nú mǐ!” Ajotɔ́ axánsúnxó ɖokpó wɛ ka nyí Balabási ɔ́.Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, Pilátu ná gbe ɖɔ è ní kplá Jezu bó zé lanbá dó xo e ná; "
The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe ,"bɔ sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ sɔ́ wun dó lɔn axɔ́súgbákún ɖokpó, bó sɔ́ xwe n'i, bó lɛ́ sɔ́ awu ɖaxó vɔvɔ cɛ́cɛ́ ɖé dó n'i. "
"Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews, “Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.” ","Pilátu lɛ́ tɔ́n wá kɔ́xo, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi ɖótó; un ná yi kplá nya mitɔn wá nú mi, bónú mi ná dó tunwun ɖɔ un kún mɔ nǔ e wú un ná ɖó hwɛ n'i é ɖě ó.” "
"When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, Jezu tɔ́n, bó ɖo awu vɔvɔ ɖaxó ɔ́ mɛ, bɔ axɔ́súgbákún ɔ́ ɖo ta n'i. Pilátu ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Nya ɔ́ ɖíe.” "
"As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, “Crucify! Crucify!” But Pilate answered, “You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.” ","Ée vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó sinsɛnxɔcɔ́tɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpó mɔ ɛ lě ɔ́, yě sú xó, bó ɖɔ: “Ká ɛ nyi aklúzu jí!

"The Jews insisted, “We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.” ","Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Mǐ ɖó sɛ́n, bɔ sɛ́n énɛ́ byɔ́ ɖɔ è ní hu i; ɖó é ɖɔ émí nyí Mawu ví.” "
"When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid, ","Ée Pilátu se mɔ̌ ɔ́, xɛsi lɛ́ ɖi i d'é jí, "
"and he went back inside the palace. “Where do you come from?” he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer. ","bɔ é lɛ́ kplá Jezu byɔ́ hɔn ɔ́ mɛ, bó kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Fítɛ́ a ka gosín?” Jezu ka kɛ nu ǎ, "
“Do you refuse to speak to me?” Pilate said. “Don't you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?” ,"bɔ Pilátu ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Nyɛ wɛ a tin dó a? A tunwun ɖɔ un ɖó acɛ bó ná ɖe we nyi te, bó lɛ́ ɖó acɛ bó ná ká we nyi aklúzu jí ǎ cé?” "
"Jesus answered, “You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.” ","Jezu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Ényí Mawu ma ná gbe tɔn we ǎ ɔ́, a sixú ɖó acɛ ɖěbǔ ɖo jǐ ce ǎ; énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ mɛ e jó mì ɔ́ hu hwɛ hú we.” "
"From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jews kept shouting, “If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar.” ","Bɛ́ sín hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, Pilátu jɛ lě e é ná wa gbɔn, bó ná ɖe Jezu nyi te ɔ́ ba jí. Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ka jɛ xó sú jí, bó ɖɔ: “Ényí a ɖe nya énɛ́ nyi te hǔn, a nyǐ Dadá Hlɔ̌ma tɔn sín xɔ́ntɔn ǎ; ɖó mɛ e sɔ́ éɖée axɔ́sú ɔ́, gǔ wɛ é fɔ́n dó Dadá Hlɔ̌ma tɔn jí.” "
"When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha). ","Ée Pilátu se mɔ̌ ɔ́, é ɖe Jezu tɔ́n, lobo wá jínjɔ́n hwɛɖɔzinkpo ɔ́ jí, ɖo tɛn e mɛ è tɛ́ awǐnnya ɖagbe ɖagbe lɛ́ɛ kɔn nyi, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ “Gabata” ɖo Ebléegbe mɛ é. "
"It was the day of Preparation of Passover Week, about the sixth hour. “Here is your king,” Pilate said to the Jews. ","Dǐndínwáyixwe kpo sɔ, bɔ yě ko ɖo xwe ɔ́ nú sɔ́ ɖ'ayǐ wɛ, xwe gan wěwe mɛ ɔ́, Pilátu ɖɔ nú Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Axɔ́sú mitɔn ɖíe.” "
"But they shouted, “Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!” “Shall I crucify your king?” Pilate asked. “We have no king but Caesar,” the chief priests answered. ","Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ka sú xó, bó ɖɔ: “È hu i! È hu i! È ká ɛ nyi aklúzu jí.” Pilátu ka kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Má ká axɔ́sú mitɔn nyi aklúzu jí wɛ a?” Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Mǐ sɔ́ ɖó axɔ́sú ɖěvo zɛ Dadá Hlɔ̌ma tɔn wú ǎ.” "
Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. So the soldiers took charge of Jesus. ,"Bɔ Pilátu jó Jezu nú yě, bónú yě ná yi ká ɛ nyi aklúzu jí. Yě kplá Jezu ɖidó. "
"Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha). ","Jezu ɖíɖá aklúzu tɔn, bó tɔ́n sín toxo ɔ́ mɛ; é ɖidó fí ɖé, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ fí ɔ́ ɖɔ “takágo”, bɔ Eblée lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ ylɔ́ fí énɛ́ ɖɔ Gɔlugɔta. "
"Here they crucified him, and with him two others–one on each side and Jesus in the middle. ","Fínɛ́ wɛ yě ká Jezu nyi aklúzu jí ɖe; è lɛ̌ ká mɛ we ɖěvo ɖó aklúzu jí; mɛ ɖokpó ɖo ɖisí tɔn xwé, mɛ wegɔ́ ɔ́ ɖo amyɔ tɔn xwé, bɔ Jezu ɖo tɛ́ntin mɛ. "
"Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. ","Pilátu wlán xógbe élɔ́, bó sɔ́ ɖó aklúzu ɔ́ jí aga ɖɔ: “Jezu Nazalɛ́ti tɔn, Jwifu lɛ́ɛ xɔ́sú.” "
"Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek. ","Jwifu gěgé mɔ nǔ e è wlǎn énɛ́ ɔ́ xa, ɖó tɛn e mɛ è ká Jezu nyi ɔ́ lín dó toxo ɔ́ ǎ. Xógbe énɛ́ ɔ́, è wlǎn dó Ebléegbe mɛ, bó wlán dó Latɛ́ɛngbe mɛ, bó lɛ́ wlán dó Glɛ̌sigbe mɛ. "
"The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The King of the Jews,’ but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews.” ",Jwifu lɛ́ɛ sín vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ wá yi ɖɔ nú Pilátu ɖɔ: “Jwifu lɛ́ɛ xɔ́sú wɛ a ɖǒ ná wlán ǎ
"Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.” ","Pilátu ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Nǔ e un ko wlán ɔ́, un wlán wɛ.” "
"When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom. ","Ée sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ ká Jezu nyi aklúzu jí vɔ ɔ́, yě bɛ́ awu tɔn lɛ́ɛ, bó má ɖó donu ɛnɛ, bɔ mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó sɔ́ étɔn. Yě lɛ́ sɔ́ awu tɔn ɖaxó e má ɖó titɔkpa ɖěbǔ ǎ, bó nyí avɔ ɖokpó sín jǐ káká wá do é. "
"“Let's not tear it,” they said to one another. “Let's decide by lot who will get it.” This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled which said, “They divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.” So this is what the soldiers did. ","Sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ ɖo yěɖée tɛ́ntin ɖɔ: “Mǐ ná vún awu élɔ́ ǎ. Mi nú mǐ ná nyi akɔ dó, bó ná tunwun mɛ e tɔn é ná nyí é.” Nǔ nyí mɔ̌, bónú nǔ e Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ ɔ́ ná dó jɛ. É wɛ nyí ɖɔ: “Yě má awu ce lɛ́ɛ, bó nyi akɔ dó awu ce ɖaxó ɔ́.” Nǔ e sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ wa ɔ́ nɛ́. "
"Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. ","Jezu sín nɔ, kpódó nɔ tɔn nɔví nyɔ̌nu Mali e nyí Klopási sín asi ɔ́ kpó, kpódó Mali Magidalanu ɔ́ kpó ɖo te, ɖo aklúzu Jezu tɔn ɔ́ kpá. "
"When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, “Dear woman, here is your son,” ","Ée Jezu mɔ nɔ tɔn, bó ka mɔ ahwanvú tɔn e é yí wǎn ná ɔ́ ɖo te ɖo akpá tɔn ɔ́, é ɖɔ nú nɔ tɔn ɖɔ: “Nǎna, vǐ towe nɛ́!” "
"and to the disciple, “Here is your mother.” From that time on, this disciple took her into his home. ","Bó ka lɛ́ ɖɔ nú ahwanvú ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Nɔ towe nɛ́!” Sín gbe énɛ́ gbe ɔ́, ahwanvú ɔ́ kplá Jezu sín nɔ dó xwé tɔn gbe. "
"Later, knowing that all was now completed, and so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, “I am thirsty.” ","Énɛ́ gúdo ɔ́, ée Jezu tunwun ɖɔ nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ fó lo ɔ́, é ɖɔ: “Kɔ xú mì!” Bónú nǔ e è wlǎn dó Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́ ná dó jɛ. "
"A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus' lips. ","Zɛ̌n ɖé ka ɖo fínɛ́, bɔ vɛ̌ɛn sinvɛ́sinvɛ́ gɔ́, sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ ka nylɔ́ xumɛtekan d'é mɛ, bó sɔ́ slɔ́ izɔ́pukpo nu, bó dlɛ́n ɖó nu n'i. "
"When he had received the drink, Jesus said, “It is finished.” With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. ","Ée Jezu nu vɛ̌ɛn sinvɛ́sinvɛ́ ɔ́, é ɖɔ: “Nǔ bǐ fó!” Bó dó kɔ do, bó bɔnu. "
"Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down. ","Gbe énɛ́ gbe ɔ́, gbɔjɛzán Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn kpo sɔ, bó jɛ dó Dǐndínwáyixwe gbe. Jwifugán lɛ́ɛ ka jló nú mɛ e è ká lɛ́ɛ ní nɔ aklúzu jí azǎn énɛ́ gbe ǎ, ɖó azǎn ɖaxó ɖé wɛ nyí azǎn énɛ́ ɔ́. Yě yi byɔ́ gbe Pilátu ɖɔ é ní gba afɔxú nú mɛ e è ká lɛ́ɛ, bó ɖe yě síin. "
"The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other. ","Pilátu ná gbe yě, bɔ sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ yi gba afɔxú nú mɛ we e è ká nyi aklúzu jí xá Jezu lɛ́ɛ; yě gba afɔxú nú mɛ nukɔn tɔn ɔ́, bó gba nú mɛ wegɔ́ ɔ́. "
"But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. ","Ée yě wá jɛ Jezu jí ɔ́, yě mɔ ɖɔ é ko kú, bɔ yě sɔ́ xaji bó gba afɔxú n'i ǎ. "
"Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water. ","Lo ɔ́, sɔ́ja ɖokpó sɔ́ hwǎn adaja mɛ n'i, bɔ tlóló ɔ́, hun kpódó sin kpó lúlú kɔn nyi ayǐ. "
"The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe. ","Mɛ e nɔ tɛn tɔn mɛ, bó mɔ é wɛ ɖe kúnnu ná, bɔ kúnnuɖiɖe tɔn ka nyí nǔgbó. Éyɛ́ tunwun ɖɔ nǔgbó wɛ émí ɖɔ, bónú mi lɔmɔ̌ ná ɖi nǔ. "
"These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: “Not one of his bones will be broken,” ","Nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ jɛ, bónú nǔ e è ko wlán ɖ'ayǐ ɖo Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́ ná dó jɛ; é wɛ nyí ɖɔ: “È nǎ gba xú tɔn ɖokpó géé lě ǎ.” "
"and, as another scripture says, “They will look on the one they have pierced.” ",È ka lɛ́ wlán dó akpá ɖěvo xwé ɖo Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ɖɔ: “Yě ná mɔ mɛ e yě sɔ́ hwǎn é.” 
"Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jews. With Pilate's permission, he came and took the body away. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, nya ɖé tíin, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Jozɛ́fu; Alimatéenu wɛ; é lɔmɔ̌ ɖo Jezu sín ahwanvú lɛ́ɛ mɛ.

"He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds. ","Nikodɛ́mu e zɔn zǎn gbe ɖokpó, bó yi mɔ Jezu ɔ́ lɔmɔ̌ wá Jezu sín cyɔ kɔn. Nikodɛ́mu xo mǐla kpódó alowɛ́si kpó kplé, bó hɛn, bɔ é ná yi kilóo gban mɔ̌. "
"Taking Jesus' body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs. ","Yě ɖíɖá Jezu sín cyɔ, bo lɛ́ akwɛ́núvɔ ɖé dó e, bo sá mǐla kpódó alowɛ́si kpó e è xokplé ɔ́ n'i, lě e Jwifu lɛ́ɛ nɔ bló gbɔn nú cyɔ cóbó nɔ ɖi é. "
"At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid. ","Jikpá ɖé ka ɖo fí e è ká Jezu nyi aklúzu jí ɖe é, bɔ yɔdo yɔ̌yɔ́ ɖokpó ɖ'é mɛ, bɔ è ko ɖi mɛ ɖěbǔ d'é mɛ kpɔ́n gbeɖé ǎ. "
"Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance. ","Fínɛ́ wɛ yě ɖi Jezu dó, ɖó yɔdo ɔ́ lín dó fínɛ́ ǎ, bɔ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ka ko ɖo gbɔjɛzán ɔ́ nú sɔ́ wɛ.Aklúnɔzán gbe zǎnzǎn hwenu e zǐnflú kpo ɖo te ɔ́, Mali Magidalanu ɔ́ yi Jezu sín yɔdo kɔn, bó mɔ ɖɔ è ɖe awǐnnya e ɖo Jezu sín yɔdo nu ɔ́ síin. "
"So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, é kán wezun yi mɔ Piyɛ́ɛ, kpódó ahwanvú ɖě ɔ́ e Jezu yí wǎn ná é kpó, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Yě ɖe Aklúnɔ sín yɔdo tɔn mɛ, bɔ mǐ tunwun fí e è sɔ́ ɛ yi ɔ́ ǎ.” "
So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb. ,"Bɔ Piyɛ́ɛ kpódó ahwanvú ɖě ɔ́ kpó tɔ́n, bó ɖidó yɔdo ɔ́ kɔn. "
"Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. ","Yě mɛ we lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ bɛ́ wezun; ahwanvú ɖě ɔ́ ka zɛ Piyɛ́ɛ wú, bó yi yɔdo ɔ́ kɔn jɛ nukɔn. "
He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in. ,"É fɛ, bó kpɔ́n yɔdo ɔ́ mɛ, bó mɔ avɔ e è lɛ̌ dó e lɛ́ɛ ɖo fínɛ́; é ka byɔ́ mɛ ǎ. "
"Then Simon Peter, who was behind him, arrived and went into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there, ","Sinmɔ́ɔ Piyɛ́ɛ wá wá gbɔn gǔdo, bó byɔ́ yɔdo ɔ́ mɛ, bó mɔ avɔ e è lɛ̌ dó e lɛ́ɛ ɖo fínɛ́; "
"as well as the burial cloth that had been around Jesus' head. The cloth was folded up by itself, separate from the linen. ",é lɛ́ mɔ avɔ e è bǔ dó ta nú Jezu ɔ́
"Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, ahwanvú ɖě ɔ́ e jɛ nukɔn nú Piyɛ́ɛ wá yɔdo ɔ́ kɔn ɔ́ lɔmɔ̌ byɔ́ mɛ; é mɔ bó ɖi nǔ. "
(They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.) ,"Nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖe bó ɖɔ Jezu ná fɔ́n sín kú ɔ́, yě ko mɔ nǔ jɛ mɛ ǎ; "
"Then the disciples went back to their homes, ",bɔ ahwanvú we énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ lɛ́ kɔ yi xwé yětɔn lɛ́ɛ gbe. 
"but Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb ","Mali ɖo te ɖo yɔdo ɔ́ kɔn, bó ɖo avǐ ya wɛ, bɔ hwenu e é ɖo avǐ ya wɛ ɔ́, é fɛ, bó kpɔ́n yɔdo ɔ́ mɛ sɛ́ dó. "
"and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus' body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot. ","É mɔ wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn we ɖo fí e è sɔ́ Jezu sín cyɔ ɖó ɔ́, bɔ yě dǒ nǔ wěwé; mɛ ɖokpó jínjɔ́n afɔligbé, bɔ mɛ ɖokpó jínjɔ́n taligbé; "
"They asked her, “Woman, why are you crying?” “They have taken my Lord away,” she said, “and I don't know where they have put him.” ","bɔ yě kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Nyɔ̌nu! Étɛ́ sín avǐ ya wɛ a ka ɖe?” É ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Yě ɖe Aklúnɔ ce síin, bɔ un tunwun fí e è sɔ́ ɛ ɖó ɔ́ ǎ.” "
"At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus. ","Ée é ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, é lílɛ́, bó mɔ Jezu ɖo te; é ka tunwun ɖɔ é wɛ ǎ. "
"“Woman,” he said, “why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?” Thinking he was the gardener, she said, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him.” ","Jezu ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Nyɔ̌nu!

"Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, “Rabboni!” (which means Teacher). ","Bɔ Jezu ylɔ́ ɛ bó ɖɔ: “Mali!” Bɔ é lílɛ́, bó ylɔ́ ɛ dó Ebléegbe mɛ ɖɔ: “Hlabúni”; (tínmɛ tɔn wɛ nyí Mɛ̌si.) "
"Jesus said, “Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’ ” ","Jezu ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Ma hɛn mì ɖó te ó, ɖó un ko yi Tɔ́ ɔ́ gɔ́n ɖo sɛ́xwé ǎ; lo ɔ́, yi ɖɔ nú nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ un xwe Tɔ́ ce e nyí Tɔ́ mi lɔ tɔn é gɔ́n; un xwe Mawu ce e nyí Mawu mi lɔ tɔn é gɔ́n.” "
Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them that he had said these things to her. ,Bɔ Mali Magidalanu ɔ́ yi ɖɔ nú ahwanvú Jezu tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Un mɔ Aklúnɔ!” Bó dó wɛn e Jezu dó e ɔ́ yě. 
"On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!” ","Gbe énɛ́ gbe aklúnɔzán gbe gbadanu ɔ́, Jezu sín ahwanvú lɛ́ɛ yi sú hɔn dó ta; ɖó yě ɖo xɛsi ɖi nú Jwifugán lɛ́ɛ wɛ, bɔ Jezu wá nɔ te, ɖo tɛ́ntin yětɔn, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Fífá ní nɔ kpɔ́ xá mi!” "
"After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord. ","Ée é ɖɔ mɔ̌ nú yě gúdo ɔ́, é xlɛ́ alɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpódó adaja tɔn kpó yě. Ée yě mɔ Aklúnɔ yětɔn ɔ́, xomɛ hun yě tlala. "
"Again Jesus said, “Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.” ","Jezu lɛ́ vɔ́ ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Fífá ní nɔ kpɔ́ xá mi. Lě e Tɔ́ ɔ́ sɛ́ mì dó ɔ́, nyi lɔ sɛ́ mi dó.” "
"And with that he breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit. ","Ée é ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, é fún funfún dó yě jí, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi yí Yɛsinsɛn. "
"If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.” ","Mi sɔ́ hwɛ kɛ mɛɖé ɔ́, é ná gosín kɔ n'i; mi ma ka sɔ́ hwɛ kɛ mɛɖé ǎ ɔ́, é ná nɔ kɔ n'i.” "
"Now Thomas (called Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came. ",Mɛ e nyí Tɔmáa ɖo ahwanvú Jezu tɔn wěwe lɛ́ɛ mɛ bɔ è nɔ lɛ́ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ hǒxo ɔ́ ɖo kpɔ́ xá yě hwenu e Jezu wá ɔ́ ǎ. 
"So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it.” ","Ahwanvú ɖě lɛ́ɛ wá ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Mǐ mɔ Aklúnɔ!” Tɔmáa ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Ényí un ma mɔ hǔnjɛ́nkpa e ɖo alɔ tɔn mɛ lɛ́ɛ, bó sɔ́ alɔví ce d'é mɛ, bó mɔ hwǎnkpa e ɖo adaja tɔn mɛ ɔ́, bó zé alɔ ce dó adaja tɔn mɛ ǎ ɔ́, un ná ɖi ǎ.” "
"A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!” ","Azǎn tɔn tántɔngɔ́ ɔ́ gbe ɔ́, ahwanvú Jezu tɔn lɛ́ɛ ko lɛ́ sú hɔn dó ta, ɖo fí ɖokpó ɔ́, bɔ Tɔmáa ɖo yě mɛ gbe énɛ́ gbe.

"Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.” ","É ka ɖɔ nú Tɔmáa ɖɔ: “Dlɛ̌n alɔví towe ɖó fí, bó kpɔ́n alɔ ce lɛ́ɛ. Dlɛ̌n alɔ towe, bó sɔ́ dó adaja ce mɛ; gɔn nǔ xokpɔ́n, bó ɖi nǔ.” "
"Thomas said to him, “My Lord and my God!” ","Tɔmáa yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ ce, Mawu ce!” "
"Then Jesus told him, “Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.” ","Jezu ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “É ma nyí ée a mɔ mì ɔ́ wútu wɛ a ɖi nǔ nú mì a? Nǔ nyɔ́ nú mɛ e ma mɔ ǎ, bó ka ɖi nǔ lɛ́ɛ.” "
"Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. ",Jezu jlɛ́ nǔ gěgé ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ ɖo ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ nukɔn
"But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Tiberias. It happened this way: ","Amɔ̌, è wlǎn élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, bónú mi ná ɖi nǔ ɖɔ Jezu wɛ nyí Klísu Mawu ví ɔ́, bónú mi ɖi nǔ ɔ́, mi ná mɔ gbɛ gbɔn jǐ tɔn.Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, Jezu lɛ́ sɔ́ éɖée xlɛ́ ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖo Tibɛliadi tɔ tó.

"Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together. ","Sinmɔ́ɔ Piyɛ́ɛ, Tɔmáa e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ hǒxo ɔ́, Natanayɛ́li e gosín Kana Galilée yíkúngban jí é, Zebeɖée ví súnnu we lɛ́ɛ, kpódó ahwanvú Jezu tɔn we ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ kpó ɖo kpɔ́. "
"“I'm going out to fish,” Simon Peter told them, and they said, “We'll go with you.” So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing. ","Sinmɔ́ɔ Piyɛ́ɛ ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Un ná yi tɔ jǐ, bó ná yi nyi ɖɔ;” bɔ mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Mǐ lɔmɔ̌ ná xwedó we yi.” Bɔ yě yi byɔ́ tɔjíhún mɛ, bó sɛ yi tɔ ɔ́ jí; yě ká wlí nǔ ɖěbǔ zǎn énɛ́ mɛ ǎ. "
"Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus. ","Ée ayǐ ɖo kinkɛn wɛ ɔ́, Jezu wá nɔ te ɖo tɔ ɔ́ tó, ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ ka tunwun ɖɔ é wɛ ǎ. "
"He called out to them, “Friends, haven't you any fish?” “No,” they answered. ",Jezu ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Vǐ ce lɛ́ɛ mi
"He said, “Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.” When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish. ","É ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi bo nyi ɖɔ ɔ́ dó ɖisíxwé nú tɔjíhún ɔ́, énɛ́ ɔ́ mi ná mɔ hweví wlí.” Yě ká nyi ɖɔ ɔ́ dó ɖisíxwé nǔgbó, bɔ ɖɔ ɔ́ wlí hweví gěgé, káká bɔ yě sɔ́ sixú dɔn tɔ́n ǎ. "
"Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, “It is the Lord,” he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, ahwanvú e Jezu yí wǎn ná ɔ́ ɖɔ nú Piyɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ wɛ!” Ée Sinmɔ́ɔ Piyɛ́ɛ se ɖɔ Aklúnɔ wɛ ɔ́, é sɔ́ awu tɔn sin dó alin, bó lɔ́n jɛ tɔ ɔ́ mɛ, ɖó é ko ɖe awu ɖ'ayǐ. "
"The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards. ","Ahwanvú ɖě lɛ́ɛ ka zɔn tɔjíhún ɔ́ mɛ wá, bó dɔn ɖɔ ɔ́, bɔ hweví gɔ́. Fí e yě ɖe dó agě ɔ́ jí ɔ́ sɔ́ lín ǎ; é ná yi mɛ̌tlu kanwe ko (100) mɔ̌. "
"When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread. ","Ée yě jɛ te ɔ́, yě mɔ myɔkán, bɔ è ɖo hweví hi ɖ'é jí wɛ; yě lɛ́ mɔ wɔ̌xúxú ɖo fínɛ́. "
"Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish you have just caught.” ",Jezu ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi fɔ hweví e mi wlí din lɛ́ɛ ɖě wǎ.” 
"Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn. ","Ée Jezu ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, Sinmɔ́ɔ Piyɛ́ɛ yi byɔ́ tɔjíhún ɔ́ mɛ, bó dɔn ɖɔ ɔ́ tɔ́n, bɔ hweví kloklo kantɔn gban-nukún-atɔn (153) ɖo ɖɔ ɔ́ mɛ, có ɖɔ ɔ́ vún ǎ. "
"Jesus said to them, “Come and have breakfast.” None of the disciples dared ask him, “Who are you?” They knew it was the Lord. ","Jezu ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi wá ɖu nǔ.” Ahwanvú lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó ka glá, bó kan mɛ e é nyí ɔ́ byɔ́ ɛ ǎ ɖó yě bǐ mɔ nǔ jɛ wú ɖɔ Aklúnɔ wɛ. "
"Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. ","Jezu ka sɛ yá yě, bó sɔ́ wɔ̌xúxú ɔ́ nú yě, bó lɛ́ sɔ́ hweví ɔ́ lɔ nú yě. "
This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead. ,"Sín hwenu e Jezu fɔ́n sín kú ɔ́, azɔn atɔngɔ́ ɔ́ nɛ́ é ɖo éɖée sɔ́ xlɛ́ ahwanvú tɔn lɛ́ɛ wɛ nɛ́. "
"When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?” “Yes, Lord,” he said, “you know that I love you.” Jesus said, “Feed my lambs.” ","Ée yě ɖu nǔ ɔ́, Jezu ɖɔ nú Sinmɔ́ɔ Piyɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Sinmɔ́ɔ Jǎan ví!

"Again Jesus said, “Simon son of John, do you truly love me?” He answered, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” Jesus said, “Take care of my sheep.” ","Jezu lɛ́ kanbyɔ́ ɛ azɔn wegɔ́ ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Sinmɔ́ɔ Jǎan ví, a yǐ wǎn nú mì ganjí a?” Bɔ Piyɛ́ɛ lɛ́ yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Ɛɛn Aklúnɔ, a tunwun ɖɔ un yí wǎn nú we.” Bɔ Jezu lɛ́ ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Kpé nukún dó lɛ̌ngbɔ́ ce lɛ́ɛ wú.” "
"The third time he said to him, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, “Do you love me?” He said, “Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.” Jesus said, “Feed my sheep. ","Jezu lɛ́ kanbyɔ́ ɛ azɔn atɔngɔ́ ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Sinmɔ́ɔ Jǎan ví, a yǐ wǎn nú mì a?” Ée Piyɛ́ɛ mɔ ɖɔ Jezu kanbyɔ́ émí azɔn atɔngɔ́ ɔ́ ɖɔ é yí wǎn nú émí a jí ɔ́, wǔ kú i, bɔ é gbɔ bó yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ, a tunwun nǔ bǐ; a tunwun ɖɔ un yí wǎn nú we.” Jezu ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Nǎ nǔɖuɖu lɛ̌ngbɔ́ ce lɛ́ɛ. "
"I tell you the truth, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.” ","Má ɖɔ nǔgbó nú we, hwenu e a ɖo dɔ̌nkpɛ mɛ ɔ́, hwi ɖésú wɛ nɔ sin gǒjíblánú towe, bó nɔ́ yi fí e jló we ɔ́ bǐ; amɔ̌, hwenu e a nǎ wá kpo nyɔ̌ɖaxó ɔ́, a nǎ dlɛ́n alɔ towe lɛ́ɛ, bɔ mɛ ɖěvo ná sin gǒjíblánú nú we, bó ná dɔn we gbɔn fí e a ma jló ǎ é.” "
"Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, “Follow me!” ","Kú alɔkpa e Piyɛ́ɛ ná kú, bó ná dó ná susu Mawu ɔ́ xlɛ́ ɛ wɛ Jezu ɖe, bó dó ɖɔ mɔ̌ n'i; énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, é ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Xwedó mì.” "
"Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, “Lord, who is going to betray you?”) ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka lɛ́ kɔ kpɔ́n gúdo, bó mɔ ahwanvú e Jezu yí wǎn ná ɔ́ jǎwe ɖo gǔdo yětɔn; ahwanvú énɛ́ wɛ sɛkpɔ́ Jezu hwenu e yě ɖo nǔ ɖu wɛ é, bó kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ, mɛ̌ ka ɖo nǎ sa we ɖu wɛ.” "
"When Peter saw him, he asked, “Lord, what about him?” ","Ée Piyɛ́ɛ mɔ ahwanvú énɛ́ ɔ́, é kanbyɔ́ Jezu ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ, mɛ élɔ́ ka lo? Étɛ́ ka ná jɛ dó éyɛ́ jí?” "
"Jesus answered, “If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.” ","Jezu ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Ényí un jló ɖɔ éyɛ́ ní nɔ ayǐ káká bónú ma lɛ́ kɔ wá ɔ́, ani wɛ kan we ɖ'é mɛ? Hwɛ ɔ́, xwedó mì.” "
"Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, “If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?” ","Xó énɛ́ gba kpé mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ mɛ, bɔ yě ɖɔ ahwanvú énɛ́ kun ɖo nǎ kú wɛ ó; Jezu ka ɖɔ é kún ná kú ó ǎ; lo ɔ́, é ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Ényí un jló ɖɔ é ní nɔ ayǐ káká bónú ma lɛ́ kɔ wá ɔ́, ani wɛ kan we ɖ'é mɛ?” "
This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true. ,"Ahwanvú énɛ́ wɛ ɖo kúnnu ɖe nú nǔ élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ; é wɛ wlán nǔ élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, bɔ mǐ tunwun ɖɔ xó nǔgbó wɛ é ɖɔ. "
"Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach ","Jezu lɛ́ wa nǔ gěgé ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ, bɔ ényí è gbɛ̌ d'é wú bó ná wlán ɖě bɔdó ɖě wú ɔ́, un ɖiɖɔ wěma tɔn ná sukpɔ́ káká bɔ gbɛ ɔ́ bǐ ná sixú hɛn ǎ.Mɛvívɛ́ná ce Teofílu!

"until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. ","káká yi jɛ gbe e gbe Mawu sɔ́ ɛ yi jǐxwé é. Cóbónú é ná yi jǐxwé ɔ́, é kplɔ́n nǔ mɛsɛ́dó e é cyán lɛ́ɛ gbɔn Yɛsinsɛn jí. "
"After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. ","Mɛsɛ́dó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ wɛ Jezu sɔ́ éɖée xlɛ́ ɖo kú tɔn gúdo, bó ɖe xlɛ́ yě gbɔn ali gěgé nu, ɖɔ émí ɖo gbɛ. Azǎn kanɖé (40) wɛ é tɔ́n dó yě jí xɔ, bó nɔ́ ɖo xó ɖɔ nú yě wɛ dó axɔ́súɖuɖu Mawu tɔn wú. "
"On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: “Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. ","Jezu ka wá ɖo nǔ ɖu xá yě wɛ gbe ɖokpó, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi ma sɛ tɛn sín Jeluzalɛ́mu ó, lo ɔ́, mi nɔ te kpɔ́n nǔ e sín akpá Mawu Tɔ́ ɔ́ dó, bɔ un ko ɖɔ xó tɔn nú mi é. "
"For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.” ","Đó Jǎan ɔ́, sin wɛ é sɔ́ dó lɛ yɛhwesin nú mɛ; lo ɔ́, midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, ɖo malín málín mɛ din ɔ́, Yɛsinsɛn wɛ è nǎ sɔ́ dó lɛ yɛhwesin nú mi.” "
"So when they met together, they asked him, “Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?” ","Kplékplé mɛ yětɔn kanbyɔ́ Jezu ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ, hwenɛ́nu wɛ a nǎ lɛ́ vɔ́ axɔ́súɖuɖu Izlayɛ́li tɔn ɔ́ sɔ́ dó alɔ mɛ nú Izlayɛ́li a?” "
He said to them: “It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority. ,"É ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ: “Hwenu e é ná nyí ɔ́, gan e mɛ ka wɛ ɔ́, Mawu Tɔ́ ɔ́ ko to kpódó acɛ tɔn kpán; é nyí xó mitɔn ɖé ǎ. "
"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” ","Lo ɔ́, mi ná mɔ acɛ yí hwenu e Yɛsinsɛn ná jɛ te wá mi jí é, bɔ mi na nyí kúnnuɖetɔ́ ce, ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu, gbɔn Judée gbé ɔ́ bǐ jí, kpódó Samalíi kpán, káká yi jɛ fí e gbɛ ɔ́ kponu ɖó é.” "
"After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight. ","Ée Jezu ɖɔ xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ gúdo ɔ́, yě ɖo kpínkpɔ́n ɛ wɛ, bɔ è sɔ́ ɛ ɖidó jǐ bɔ akpɔ́kpɔ́ ɖé wá bú i. "
"They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them. ","Fínɛ́ wɛ yě ɖe, bó ɖo jǐnukúnsin kpɔ́n sɛ́ dó wɛ hwenu e é ɖo yiyi wɛ ɔ́, bɔ nya we ɖé lɛ́ɛ dó awu wěwé, bó tɔ́n ɖo akpá yětɔn, "
"“Men of Galilee,” they said, “why do you stand here looking into the sky?

"Then they returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives, a Sabbath day's walk from the city. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ jɛ te sín olívutín só ɔ́ jí, bó lɛ́ kɔ wá yi Jeluzalɛ́mu; só énɛ́ lín dó toxo ɔ́ ǎ; é ná ɖó kilomɛ́tlu ɖokpó mɔ̌ dó toxo ɔ́. "
"When they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying. Those present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James. ","Ée yě wá toxo ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, yě byɔ́ xɔ e mɛ yě ko nɔ́ nɔ ɖ'ayǐ é mɛ, ɖo síngbó ɖé jí.

"Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, ","“Énɛ́ wú ɔ́, mɛ e xwedó mǐ hwenu e Aklúnɔ Jezu gbɔn to lɛ́ɛ mɛ to lɛ́ɛ mɛ xá mǐ, bɛ́ sín gbe e gbe Jǎan lɛ yɛhwesin n'i ɔ́ káká yi jɛ gbe e gbe è sɔ́ ɛ sín mǐ mɛ yi jǐxwé ɔ́ ɖokpó ɖó ná gɔ́ nú mǐ, bó ná nɔ́ ɖe kúnnu ɖɔ Jezu fɔ́n sín kú.” "
So they proposed two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, yě sɔ́ mɛ we ɖó te: Jozɛ́fu kpó Matyasi kpó; Jozɛ́fu ɔ́ nɔ́ lɛ́ nyí Baasabási, bɔ è nɔ lɛ́ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Jusitúsi. "
"Then they prayed, “Lord, you know everyone's heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, yě xo ɖɛ, bó ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ, hwi mɛ e nɔ mɔ nǔ jɛ mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó sín ayi mɛ é, xlɛ́ mɛ e a sɔ́ ɖo mɛ we élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ mɛ é mǐ, "

"Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles.When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.

Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. ,"Tlóló ɔ́, zǐngídi ɖé gosín jǐxwé jɔhɔn ɖaxó ɖé wɛ ɖo nyinyi wɛ ɖɔhun, bó kpé xwé e gbe yě ɖe ɔ́ bǐ, "

Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. ,"Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, Jwifu e nɔ xwedó Mawusɛ́n ɔ́ lɛ́ɛ gěgé ká gosín to e ɖo ayǐkúngban jí é bǐ mɛ, bó wá ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu. "
"When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. ","Ée yě se zǐngídi énɛ́ ɔ́, yě nyi ahwan wá kplé, bɔ xó e ɖɔ wɛ mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ ɖe ɔ́ fyán yě tlala, ɖó mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó nɔ́ se xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ dó é ɖésúnɔ sín gbe mɛ; "

"When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways.”The priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to Peter and John while they were speaking to the people.

They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead. ,"Nǔ e kplɔ́n togun ɔ́ wɛ mɛsɛ́dó we énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖe, bó ɖɔ Jezu fɔ́n sín kú, lobo dó ɖo ɖiɖe xlɛ́ gbɔn fínɛ́ wɛ ɖɔ mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ ná fɔ́n sín kú ɔ́, é vɛ́ yě wú, "

"But many who heard the message believed, and the number of men grew to about five thousand. ","Nǔ ka ɖo mɔ̌ có, mɛ e se xó e mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ ɔ́ gěgé ɖi nǔ. Mɛ e ɖi nǔ lɛ́ɛ ná yi děgba ɖě afatɔ́n (5.000) mɔ̌. "
"The next day the rulers, elders and teachers of the law met in Jerusalem. ","Ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn ɔ́, Jwifugán lɛ́ɛ, tomɛxó lɛ́ɛ, kpódó sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpán wá kplé ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu. "

They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: “By what power or what name did you do this?” ,"Yě zɔ̌n bɔ è kplá Piyɛ́ɛ kpódó Jǎan kpán wá nukɔn yětɔn, bɔ yě kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ jí: “Mɛ̌ sín acɛ mɛ abǐ mɛ̌ sín nyǐkɔ mɛ mi ka bló nǔ énɛ́ dó?” "
"Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: “Rulers and elders of the people! ","Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, Yɛsinsɛn gɔ́ ayi mɛ nú Piyɛ́ɛ bɔ é ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ jí: “Gǎn lɛ́ɛ mi; tomɛxó lɛ́ɛ mi; "

"then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed.

"Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.” ","É ɖokpónɔ géé jɛ́n sixú hwlɛ́n mɛ gán; ɖó, gbɔn gbɛ ɔ́ bǐ mɛ ɔ́, Mawu sɔ́ ná mɛ ɖěvo gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖo fí ɖěbǔ, bɔ mi ná mɔ hwlɛngán gbɔn jǐ tɔn ǎ.” "
"When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus.

"But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, there was nothing they could say. ","Lo ɔ́, ée yě mɔ mɛ e yě gbɔ azɔn ná ɔ́ ɖo te ɖo yě kpá ɔ́, yě sɔ́ tunwun nǔ e yě ná ɖɔ d'é wú ɔ́ ǎ. "
So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and then conferred together. ,"Yě ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ yě ní tɔ́n sín toxóɖɔgbɛ́ ɔ́ xɔsá, bó jɛ xó ɔ́ gbéjé kpɔ́n jí ɖo yěɖée tɛ́ntin. "
"“What are we going to do with these men?” they asked. “Everybody living in Jerusalem knows they have done an outstanding miracle, and we cannot deny it.

"But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, we must warn these men to speak no longer to anyone in this name.” ","Lo ɔ́, mǐ ná tɛ́nkpɔ́n nú xó ɔ́ má sɔ́ gba kpé d'é jí ɖo togun ɔ́ mɛ ó; mǐ ná ván nukún dó yě, bó dó sɛ́n nú yě ɖɔ yě ma sɔ́ ɖɔ xó nú mɛ ɖěbǔ ɖo Jezu nyǐkɔ mɛ ó.” "
Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. ,"Ée yě ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě ylɔ́ Piyɛ́ɛ kpódó Jǎan kpán, bó dó sɛ́n nú yě syɛ́nsyɛ́n ɖɔ yě ma sɔ́ ɖɔ xó dó Jezu nyíkɔ mɛ ɖě ó, yě ma ka sɔ́ kplɔ́n nǔ mɛ dó nyǐkɔ tɔn mɛ ɖě ó. "
"But Peter and John replied, “Judge for yourselves whether it is right in God's sight to obey you rather than God. ","Piyɛ́ɛ kpódó Jǎan kpán ka yí xó, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi ɖésú mi kpɔ́n ɖɔ é sɔgbe ɖo Mawu nukɔn ɖɔ è nǐ se tónú nú mi hú è nǐ se tónú nú Mawu ají. "
For we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.” ,"Mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, nǔ e mǐ mɔ, lobo se ɔ́, mǐ sixú gɔn ɖiɖɔ gbeɖé ǎ.” "
"After further threats they let them go. They could not decide how to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened. ","Ée yě ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, mɛ e ɖo toxóɖɔgbɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ lɛ́ ván nukún dó yě, lobo jó yě. Yě tunwun lě e yě ná dɔn tó nú yě gbɔn é ǎ, ɖó togun ɔ́ wú.

For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old. ,Nya e sín azɔn gbɔ gbɔn nǔ e Jezu jlɛ́ gbɔn yě jí nɛ́ ɔ́ gbla mɛ ɔ́ ko ɖó xwe kanɖé (40) zɛ wú. 
"On their release, Peter and John went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them. ","Ée è jǒ Piyɛ́ɛ kpódó Jǎan kpán gúdo ɔ́, yě lɛ́ kɔ yi gbɛ̌ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ gɔ́n, bɔ nǔ e vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó tomɛxó lɛ́ɛ kpán ɖɔ ɔ́, yě wlí bǐ ɖɔ nú yě. "
"When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God. “Sovereign Lord,” they said, “you made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and everything in them. ","Ée gbɛ̌ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ se xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, yě bǐ ɖó gbe kpɔ́, bó ɖɔ nú Mawu ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ! Hwi wɛ bló jǐxwé kpódó ayǐkúngban kpán, bó lɛ́ bló xu kpódó nǔ e ɖ'é mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ sésé kpán. "

The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the Lord and against his Anointed One. ’ ,"Axɔ́sú e ɖo wɛ̌kɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ sɔ́ ahwan nú, bɔ gǎn lɛ́ɛ ɖó gbe kpɔ́, bó tɔ́n ahwan Aklúnɔ Mawu kpó Klísu tɔn kpó.’ "
"Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in this city to conspire against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed.

They did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen. ,"Yě ɖó gbe kpɔ́, bó bló nǔ e hwi ɖésúnɔ kó jló, bó kó ɖe wě tɔn ɖ'ayǐ ɖo hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n towe mɛ ɔ́ bǐ. "
"Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness. ","Din ɔ́, Aklúnɔ, kpɔ́n adǎn e gblɔ́n nú mǐ wɛ yě ɖe é, bó bló bónú mǐ mɛ mɛsɛntɔ́ towe lɛ́ɛ ná ɖó akɔ́nkpinkpan, bó jlá xó towe kpódó jiɖiɖe bǐ kpán. "
Stretch out your hand to heal and perform miraculous signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.” ,"Dlɛ̌n alɔ towe, bónú nǔjlɛ́jlɛ́ lɛ́ɛ kpódó nǔdábaɖa lɛ́ɛ kpó ná tíin, ɖo mɛsɛntɔ́ towe mímɛ́ Jezu sín nyǐkɔ mɛ.” "
"After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly. ","Ée yě xo ɖɛ fó ɔ́, fí e yě kplé ɖe ɔ́ dán wǔ. Yɛsinsɛn gɔ́ ayi mɛ nú yě, bɔ yě jɛ Mawuxó jlá jí, kpódó jiɖiɖe kpán. "
"All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of his possessions was his own, but they shared everything they had.

"Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means Son of Encouragement), ","Mɔ̌ wɛ nya ɖé tíin, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Jozɛ́fu; mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ ká sun nyǐ i ɖɔ Baanabási, (tínmɛ tɔn wɛ nyí gbɔdónúmɛtɔ́,) Levíi ví wɛ bɔ è ji i ɖo Cíplu. "
"sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles' feet.Now a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of property.

"With his wife's full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself, but brought the rest and put it at the apostles' feet. ","É ɖɔ xá asi tɔn, bɔ yě ɖe akwɛ́ e yě sa ayǐkúngban ɔ́ yí ɔ́ kpo, bɔ é sɔ́ ée kpo ɔ́ yi jó nú mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ. "
"Then Peter said, “Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land? ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Ananíyasi! Aniwú Satáan gɔ́ ayi mɛ nú we mɔ̌, bó zɔ́n bɔ a ɖe akwɛ́ e a dǒ sa ayǐkúngban ɔ́ ná ɔ́ kpo, bó wá ɖo nǔvú ɖó nú Yɛsinsɛn wɛ? "
"Didn't it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied to men but to God.” ","Hwenu e a ma ko sa ayǐkúngban ɔ́ ǎ ɔ́, towe wɛ é nyí ǎ cé? Ée a ka wá sa ɔ́, akwɛ́ tɔn ɔ́, é má nyí towe wɛ é nyí a? Fítɛ́ a ka ba ayi hízíhízí mɔ̌hun sín?

"When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard what had happened. ","Ée Ananíyasi se xó énɛ́ ɔ́, é jɛ ayǐ, bó kú cúɖúɖú, bɔ xɛsi ɖaxó ɖé jɛ mɛ e se nǔ énɛ́ e jɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ jí. "
"Then the young men came forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and buried him. ","Dɔ̌nkpɛvú e ɖo fínɛ́ lɛ́ɛ sí te, bó bú avɔ dó cyɔ tɔn, lobo sɔ́ ɛ yi ɖi. "
"About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. ","É bló ganxixo atɔn mɔ̌, bɔ asi tɔn lɔmɔ̌ wá xwetɔ́n; é ka ko se nǔ e jɛ ɔ́ ǎ. "
"Peter asked her, “Tell me, is this the price you and Ananias got for the land?” “Yes,” she said, “that is the price.” ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka ylɔ́ ɛ, bó kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Akwɛ́ élɔ́ wɛ mi sa ayǐkúngban mitɔn yí a? Đɔ nú mǐ.” É ka yí gbe ɖɔ: “Ɛɛn, mɔ̌ jɛ́n mǐ sa yí hǔn.” "
"Peter said to her, “How could you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also.” ","Ée é ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, Piyɛ́ɛ ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Nɛ̌ ka gbɔn bɔ hwi kpódó asú towe kpó blá ɖɔ, bó jló ná ba do nú Yɛ Aklúnɔ tɔn kpɔ́n mɔ̌?

"At that moment she fell down at his feet and died. Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband.

Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events. ,"Bɔ xɛsi ɖaxó ɖé jɛ agun nǔɖitɔ́ lɛ́ɛ tɔn ɔ́ bǐ jí, bó jɛ mɛ e se nǔ énɛ́ e jɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ jí. "
The apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders among the people. And all the believers used to meet together in Solomon's Colonnade. ,"Mawu jlɛ́ nǔ gěgé, bó ɖe nǔdábaɖa gěgé xlɛ́ gbɔn mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ jí, ɖo togun ɔ́ mɛ. Nǔɖitɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ nɔ́ nɔ kpɔ́ ɖo Salomɔ́ɔ gba jí. "
"No one else dared join them, even though they were highly regarded by the people. ","Mɛɖěvo sɔ́ nɔ́ glá gɔ́ nú yě ǎ; lo ɔ́, togun ɔ́ yí wǎn nú yě ɖésú. "
"Nevertheless, more and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to their number. ","Mɛ e ɖo nǔ ɖi nú Aklúnɔ wɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖo kpɔ́ su d'é jí wɛ, ɖo súnnu mɛ, ɖo nyɔ̌nu mɛ. "
"As a result, people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by. ","Bɔ mɛ lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ zé azinzɔnnɔ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ wá ɖó ali lɛ́ɛ xo; yě nɔ́ tɛ́ yě dó akánma jí, bó nɔ́ lɛ́ tɛ́ yě dó zan jí bónú Piyɛ́ɛ wá xweyǐgbe ɔ́, yɛ tɔn ná gbɛ́ gbɔn mɛ ɖěe jí ɖo yě mɛ vɔ́vɔ́. "
"Crowds gathered also from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those tormented by evil spirits, and all of them were healed.

They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail. ,"Yě wlí yě dó gankpá mɛ, fí e è nɔ wlí mɛ kpaa lɛ́ɛ sú dó é. "
But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out. ,"Lo ɔ́, ée zǎn kú ɔ́, wɛnsagun Aklúnɔ tɔn ɖokpó hun gankpá ɔ́ sín hɔn lɛ́ɛ, bó kplá yě jɛ hɔnto, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: "

"At daybreak they entered the temple courts, as they had been told, and began to teach the people. When the high priest and his associates arrived, they called together the Sanhedrin–the full assembly of the elders of Israel–and sent to the jail for the apostles. ","Ée yě se mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě fɔ́n zǎn yi sinsɛnxɔ mɛ, bó jɛ nǔ kplɔ́n mɛ lɛ́ɛ jí.

"On hearing this report, the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests were puzzled, wondering what would come of this. ","Ée sinsɛnxɔcɔ́tɔ́ lɛ́ɛ sín gǎn, kpódó vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpán se mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě bǔ ayǐ ɖo mɛsɛ́dó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ sín xó kpódó nǔ e ná wá jɛ gúdo lɛ́ɛ kpó mɛ. "

"We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.” ",Mǐ nyí kúnnuɖetɔ́ nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ tɔn
"When they heard this, they were furious and wanted to put them to death. ","Ée toxóɖɔtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ se xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, xomɛ sin yě tlala, bɔ yě jló ná hu mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ. "
"But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a little while. ","Lo ɔ́, Falizyɛn ɖokpó ɖo yě mɛ hwenɛ́nu; è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Gamaliyɛ́li; sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ ɖaxó ɖokpó wɛ é nyí, bɔ to ɔ́ bǐ nɔ́ sí i.

"Then he addressed them: “Men of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do to these men. ","Énɛ́ gúdo ɔ́, é ɖɔ nú toxóɖɔtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Izlayɛ́li ví e mi, mi hɛn ayi dó nǔ e wa xá mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ gbé mi ja ɔ́ wú. "
"Some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing. ","É kó lín din ǎ, bɔ Tedasi sí te ɖo fí, bó ɖɔ émí jɛ́n tíin, bɔ súnnu mɛxó ná yi afɔwe (400) mɔ̌ xwedó e. È ka hu i, bɔ mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ gbadó, bɔ xó fó. "
"After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were scattered. ","Éyɛ́ gúdo ɔ́, Judási Galiléenu ɔ́ sí te, ɖo mɛxixa hwenu, bó dɔn ahwan dó éɖée jí; é lɔmɔ̌ kú, bɔ mɛ e xwedó e lɛ́ɛ bǐ gbadó. "
"Therefore, in the present case I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail. ","Din ɔ́, ma ɖɔ nú mi, mi ma sɔ́ kpɔ́n mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖě sín jɛ jí ó; mi jó yě dó nú yě yi. Đó ényí tito yětɔn abǐ nǔwiwa yětɔn ɔ́, gbɛtɔ́ gɔ́n wɛ é gosín ɔ́, é ná sú dó. "
"But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God.” ","Lo ɔ́, é ka nyí ɖɔ Mawu sín nǔwiwa wɛ ɔ́, mi sixú kpé wú bó sú dó ǎ; mi cɔ́ miɖée, bó má tɔ́n ahwan Mawu ó.” "
"His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. ","Ée é ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě bǐ yí gbe nú xó tɔn, bó ka ylɔ́ mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ, lobo zɔ́n bɔ è xo yě, bó dó sɛ́n nú yě ɖɔ yě má sɔ́ ɖɔ xó dó Jezu nyǐkɔ tamɛ ɖě ó, lobo jó yě dó. "
"The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name. ","Mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ ka gosín toxóɖɔgbɛ́ ɔ́ nukɔn, bɔ xomɛ hun yě tlala, ɖó yě mɔ ɖɔ Mawu mɔ émí dó mɔ mɛ e jɛ xá ya ji dó Jezu nyǐkɔ mɛ é. "
"Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Christ.In those days when the number of disciples was increasing, the Grecian Jews among them complained against the Hebraic Jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food. ","Ayǐhɔ́ngbe ayǐhɔ́ngbe ɔ́, yě nɔ́ gɔn nǔ kplɔ́n mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖo sinsɛnxɔ mɛ mɛ kpó xwé lɛ́ɛ gbe kpó ǎ, yě ka nɔ́ gɔn Wɛn Ɖagbe e ɖɔ xó dó Jezu-Klísu wú ɔ́ jlá yě ǎ.Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, ahwanvú lɛ́ɛ wá ɖo kpɔ́ sú d'é jí wɛ, bɔ Jwifu e nɔ xwedó walɔ Glɛ̌sinu lɛ́ɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ wá jɛ nǔ hlún ɖɔ dó Jwifu e nɔ xwedó walɔ Eblée lɛ́ɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ wú jí.

"So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, “It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables. ","Énɛ́ wú wɛ mɛsɛ́dó wěwe lɛ́ɛ wá ylɔ́ ahwanvú lɛ́ɛ bǐ kplé, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “É jɛ xá ɖɔ mǐ ní jó Mawuxó jlájlá dó, bó wá yi ɖo nǔɖuɖu má wɛ ǎ. "
"Brothers, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, mi gbɔ bo kpɔ́n miɖée mɛ, bó cyán súnnu tɛ́nwe e ɖó jijɔ ɖagbe, bɔ Yɛsinsɛn kpó nǔnywɛ́ kpó gɔ́ ayi mɛ ná lɛ́ɛ é, bónú mǐ ná sɔ́ yě ɖó azɔ̌ énɛ́ ɔ́ nu.

and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word.” ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mǐ ná kpé nukún dó ɖɛxixo kpódó Mawuxó jlájlá kpó wú.” "
"This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit; also Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism. ","Xó énɛ́ nyɔ́ agun ɔ́ bǐ nukún mɛ, bɔ yě cyán mɛ tɛ́nwe élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ: Etyɛ́ni, nya nǔɖitɔ́ titewungbe ɖé wɛ, bɔ Yɛsinsɛn gɔ́ ayi mɛ n'i; Filípu kpó Plokɔ́ɔ kpó, Nikanɔ́ɔ kpó Timɔ́ɔ kpó, Pamɛnási kpódó Nikoláa Antyɔ́cinu e ko byɔ́ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ sín sinsɛn mɛ ɖ'ayǐ ɔ́ kpán. "
"They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them. ","Yě wá kplá yě mɛ tɛ́nwe lɛ́ɛ yi mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ gɔ́n, bɔ mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ xo ɖɛ, bó ɖó alɔ yě jí. "
"So the word of God spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith. ","Mawuxó ɔ́ ka jɛ gbigba kpé jí, bɔ ahwanvú lɛ́ɛ ɖo kpɔ́ sú d'é jí wɛ ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu, bɔ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ wɔ̌buwɔ́bú ɖé lɛ́ɛ jɛ nǔ ɖi nú Jezu jí ɖo Jwifu lɛ́ɛ mɛ. "
"Now Stephen, a man full of God's grace and power, did great wonders and miraculous signs among the people. ","Mawu tún acɛ dó Etyɛ́ni jí, bó ná ɛ hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n, bɔ é nɔ́ ɖo nǔdábaɖa ɖe tɔ́n wɛ, bó nɔ́ ɖo nǔ ɖaxó ɖaxó lɛ́ɛ jlɛ́ wɛ ɖo togun ɔ́ tɛ́ntin. "
"Opposition arose, however, from members of the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called)–Jews of Cyrene and Alexandria as well as the provinces of Cilicia and Asia. These men began to argue with Stephen, ","Jwifu ɖé lɛ́ɛ ka gosín kplɔ́ngbasá e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ “Kannumɔ e jɛ yěɖée sí lɛ́ɛ tɔn é” bó wá, bó jɛ nǔ dɔn xá Etyɛ́ni jí; to vovo mɛ wɛ Jwifu énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ gosín; mɛ ɖě gosín Silenɛ́ɛ, Alɛsándli, Silisíi kpódó Azíi yíkúngban jí kpó.

but they could not stand up against his wisdom or the Spirit by whom he spoke. ,"Lo ɔ́, yě nɔ́ sixú nɔ te Etyɛ́ni nukɔn ǎ, ɖó é nɔ́ ɖo xó ɖɔ wɛ kpódó nǔnywɛ́ e Yɛsinsɛn ná ɛ ɔ́ kpó. "
"Then they secretly persuaded some men to say, “We have heard Stephen speak words of blasphemy against Moses and against God.” ","Bɔ yě gbɔ bó dɔn mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ dó awo mɛ, bó ná akwɛ́ yě, bónú yě ná ɖó adingban dó Etyɛ́ni kɔ ɖɔ: “Mǐ se nya élɔ́ ɖo nu nylá dó Mawu kpódó Mɔyízi kpán wú wɛ.” "
So they stirred up the people and the elders and the teachers of the law. They seized Stephen and brought him before the Sanhedrin. ,"Xó énɛ́ e yě kpá ɖɔ ɔ́ zɔ́n bɔ togun ɔ́ kpódó tomɛxó lɛ́ɛ kpó, kpódó sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpán bǐ xo zǐn, bó zɔn Etyɛ́ni jí bó wlí, lobo kplá ɛ hɛn yi toxóɖɔgbɛ́ ɔ́ nukɔn.

"They produced false witnesses, who testified, “This fellow never stops speaking against this holy place and against the law. ","Yě lɛ́ kplá kúnnu-agɔɖetɔ́ ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ wá, bɔ yě ɖɔ: “Nya élɔ́ nɔ́ gɔn nu nylá dó sinsɛnxɔ mímɛ́ mǐtɔn élɔ́ kpódó Mɔyízi sɛ́n ɔ́ kpán wú ǎ. "
For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs Moses handed down to us.” ,"Đó mǐ se bɔ é ɖɔ Jezu Nazalɛ́tinu ɔ́ ná gba sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́, lobo ná húzú hwɛndo e Mɔyízi ɖó ayǐ nú mǐ é.” "
"All who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen, and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.Then the high priest asked him, “Are these charges true?” ","Mɛ e ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n ɖo toxóɖɔgbɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ bɔ nukún nyi Etyɛ́ni wú, bɔ nukún mɛ tɔn cí wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ sín nukún mɛ ɖɔhun ɖo yě nukún mɛ.Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó ɔ́ kanbyɔ́ Etyɛ́ni ɖɔ: “Nǔ nyí mɔ̌ nǔgbó a?” "
"To this he replied: “Brothers and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran. ","Bɔ Etyɛ́ni yí xó, bó ɖɔ: “Nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, tɔ́ ce lɛ́ɛ mi, mi ɖótó mì. Mawu susunɔ ɔ́ tɔ́n dó tɔ́gbó mǐtɔn Ablaxámu jí hwenu e é kpo ɖo Mɛzopotamíi, bó ma kó yi sá xwé ɖó Haláani ǎ é, "
"‘Leave your country and your people,’ God said, ‘and go to the land I will show you.’ ","bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: ‘Tɔ́n sín to towe mɛ; tɔ́n sín hɛ̌nnumɔ towe lɛ́ɛ mɛ, bó yi to e un ná xlɛ́ we ɔ́ mɛ.’ "
"“So he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. After the death of his father, God sent him to this land where you are now living. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, Ablaxámu gosín Kaludéenu lɛ́ɛ tomɛ, bó wá sá xwé dó Haláani; ée tɔ́ tɔn kú gúdo ɔ́, Mawu ɖe e sín fínɛ́, bó sɔ́ ɛ wá to e mɛ mi ɖe din é mɛ. "
"He gave him no inheritance here, not even a foot of ground. But God promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land, even though at that time Abraham had no child. ","Mawu ná ayǐkúngban ɖěbǔ Ablaxámu ɖo tomɛ fí ǎ; ayǐkúngban alɔbá ɖokpó vɔ́vɔ́ nyí étɔn ǎ.

"God spoke to him in this way: ‘Your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years. ","Mawu ka lɛ́ ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: ‘Vǐvú towe lɛ́ɛ ná yi cí mɛ ɖěvo tomɛ, bɔ è nǎ sɔ́ yě dó ɖó kannumɔ, lobo ná dó ya nú yě xɔ xwe afɔwe (400). "
"But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,’ God said, ‘and afterward they will come out of that country and worship me in this place.’ ","Amɔ̌, un ná ɖɔ hwɛ xá akɔta e mɛ yě ná nyí kannumɔ ɖe é. Énɛ́ gúdo ɔ́, yě ná gosín to ɔ́ mɛ, bó ná wá sɛn mì ɖo fí.’ "
"Then he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. And Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him eight days after his birth. Later Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs. ","Bɔ Mawu jɛ akɔ xá ɛ, bó sɔ́ adagbigbo dó ɖó akɔjijɛ énɛ́ sín wuntun.

"“Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph, they sold him as a slave into Egypt. But God was with him ","“Tɔ́gbó mǐtɔn énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ hwan wǔ dó nɔví yětɔn Jozɛ́fu, lobo sɔ́ ɛ yi sa, bɔ è kplá ɛ yi Ejípu; lo ɔ́, Mawu nɔ gǔdo tɔn, "
and rescued him from all his troubles. He gave Joseph wisdom and enabled him to gain the goodwill of Pharaoh king of Egypt,Fon
"“Then a famine struck all Egypt and Canaan, bringing great suffering, and our fathers could not find food. ","Adɔ ɖé ka tɔ́n ɖo Ejípu kpódó Kanáa kpó, bɔ mɛ bǐ jɛ ya ɖaxó ɖé mɛ, tɔ́gbó mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ sɔ́ mɔ nǔɖé ná ɖu ǎ. "
"When Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers on their first visit. ","Jakɔ́bu ka se ɖɔ jinukún ɖo Ejípu, lobo sɛ́ tɔ́gbó mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ dó azɔn nukɔn tɔn ɔ́. "
"On their second visit, Joseph told his brothers who he was, and Pharaoh learned about Joseph's family. ","Azɔn wegɔ́ e é sɛ́ yě dó ɔ́, Jozɛ́fu ɖe éɖée xlɛ́ nɔví tɔn lɛ́ɛ, bɔ Ejípu xɔ́sú ɔ́ wá tunwun hɛ̌nnu e mɛ Jozɛ́fu gosín é. "
"After this, Joseph sent for his father Jacob and his whole family, seventy-five in all. ",Jozɛ́fu sɛ́ yě dó ɖɔ yě ní yi kplá tɔ́ émítɔn Jakɔ́bu ɔ́ kpódó hɛ̌nnumɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpán wá nú émí
"Then Jacob went down to Egypt, where he and our fathers died. ","Jakɔ́bu wá yi Ejípu; fínɛ́ wɛ é kú ɖe, bɔ tɔ́gbó mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌ kú ɖo fínɛ́. "
Their bodies were brought back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a certain sum of money. ,"È sɔ́ cyɔ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ yi Sikɛ́mu, bó ɖi yě dó yɔdo e Ablaxámu sɔ́ akwɛ́ dó xɔ ná ɖo Hamɔ́ɔ vǐ lɛ́ɛ sí é mɛ. "
"“As the time drew near for God to fulfill his promise to Abraham, the number of our people in Egypt greatly increased. ","“Hwenu e Mawu ná ɖe akpá e é dó nú Ablaxámu ɔ́ wá ɖo susu wɛ; bɔ togun Izlayɛ́li tɔn ɔ́ ɖo jiji d'é jí wɛ, bó ɖo kpɔ́ sú d'é jí wɛ ɖo Ejípu; "
"Then another king, who knew nothing about Joseph, became ruler of Egypt. ",yě ɖo kpɔ́ su d'é jí wɛ mɔ̌ káká yi jɛ axɔ́sú Ejípu tɔn ɖěvo e ma tunwun Jozɛ́fu ǎ é hwenu. 
He dealt treacherously with our people and oppressed our forefathers by forcing them to throw out their newborn babies so that they would die. ,"Axɔ́sú énɛ́ ɔ́ zán ayi dídá dó akɔta mǐtɔn wú, bó dó ya nú tɔ́gbó mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ káká, lobo zɔ́n ɖɔ yě ní nɔ́ sɔ́ vǐ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ nyi gbě, nú yě ma nɔ gbɛ ó. "
"“At that time Moses was born, and he was no ordinary child. For three months he was cared for in his father's house. ","Hwenɛ́nu wɛ è ji Mɔyízi, bɔ é nyɔ́ ɖɛkpɛ ɖésú ɖo Mawu nukún mɛ. Mɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpé nukún wú tɔn ɖo tɔ́ tɔn sín xwé gbe xɔ sun atɔn. "
"When he was placed outside, Pharaoh's daughter took him and brought him up as her own son. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, yě wá sɔ́ ɛ nyi gbě, bɔ Ejípu xɔ́sú ɔ́ sín vǐ nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ wá sɔ́ ɛ, bó hɛn ɛ vǐ é ɖésúnɔ tɔn ɖɔhun. "
Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and action. ,"Fínɛ́ wɛ é yí nǔnywɛ́ Ejípunu lɛ́ɛ tɔn bǐ ɖe, bó lí dǒ ɖo xóɖiɖɔ kpódó nǔwiwa kpó mɛ. "
"“When Moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his fellow Israelites. ","“Hwenu e é ɖó xwe kanɖé (40) ɔ́, nɔví tɔn Izlayɛ́li ví lɛ́ɛ sín nǔ byɔ́ ayi mɛ n'i, bɔ é ɖɔ émí ná yi kpɔ́n lě e yě ɖe gbɔn é. "
"He saw one of them being mistreated by an Egyptian, so he went to his defense and avenged him by killing the Egyptian. ","Ée é yi ɔ́, é mɔ Ejípunu ɖé ɖo ya dó nú Izlayɛ́li ví ɖokpó wɛ, bó jɛ ahwan jǐ tɔn; é ba hlɔn, bó hu Ejípunu ɔ́. "
"Moses thought that his own people would realize that God was using him to rescue them, but they did not. ",É vɛdó ɖɔ nɔví émítɔn lɛ́ɛ ná mɔ nǔ jɛ mɛ ɖɔ Mawu wɛ sɛ́ émí dó ɖɔ émí ní wá hwlɛ́n yě gán sín
"The next day Moses came upon two Israelites who were fighting. He tried to reconcile them by saying, ‘Men, you are brothers; why do you want to hurt each other?’ ","Ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn ɔ́, Mɔyízi mɔ Izlayɛ́li ví we ɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖo hun xo wɛ, lobo jló ná kɔ́ nǔ nú yě, bó ɖɔ: ‘Xɔ́ntɔn ce lɛ́ɛ mi; nɔví wɛ mi nyí hǔn.

"“But the man who was mistreating the other pushed Moses aside and said, ‘Who made you ruler and judge over us? ","Mɛ e ɖo mɛ tɔn wegɔ́ ɔ́ dó ya ná wɛ ɔ́ ká sísɛ́ Mɔyízi bó ɖɔ jí: ‘Mɛ̌ ká sɔ́ we gǎn, abǐ hwɛɖɔtɔ́ ɖo mǐ nu? "
Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’ ,A jlǒ ná hu mì lě e a hu Ejípunu ɔ́ gbɔn sɔ é wɛ a?’ 
"When Moses heard this, he fled to Midian, where he settled as a foreigner and had two sons. ","Ée Mɔyízi se mɔ̌ ɔ́, é hɔn bó yi cí to e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Madiáani ɔ́ mɛ, bó ji vǐ súnnu we ɖo fínɛ́. "
"“After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai. ","“Xwe kanɖé (40) wá yi, bɔ wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn ɖokpó wá tɔ́n dó jǐ tɔn ɖo gbětótló Sinayíi só tɔn mɛ, ɖo zungodwe ɖé mɛ, bɔ zungodwe ɔ́ ɖo zo ji wɛ. "
"When he saw this, he was amazed at the sight. As he went over to look more closely, he heard the Lord's voice: ","Nǔ énɛ́ e Mɔyízi mɔ ɔ́ kpácá ɛ tlala, bɔ é jló ná sɛ yá, bó ná kpɔ́n tlítlí tɔn, lobo ká se Aklúnɔ sín gbe bɔ é ɖɔ jí: "
"‘I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.’ Moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look. ","‘Nyɛ wɛ nyí Mawu tɔ́gbó towe lɛ́ɛ tɔn; Mawu Ablaxámu tɔn; Mawu Izáki tɔn; Mawu Jakɔ́bu tɔn.’ Ée Mɔyízi se mɔ̌ ɔ́, é jɛ sísɔ́sísɔ́ jí, bó sɔ́ glá, bó kpɔ́n ǎ. "
"“Then the Lord said to him, ‘Take off your sandals; the place where you are standing is holy ground. ","Aklúnɔ ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: ‘ɖe afɔkpa towe lɛ́ɛ, ɖó ayǐkúngban e jí a ɖo te ɖe ɔ́, ayǐkúngban mímɛ́ wɛ. "
"I have indeed seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groaning and have come down to set them free. Now come, I will send you back to Egypt.’ ","Un mɔ ya e ji wɛ togun ce ɖe ɖo Ejípu ɔ́ ganjí. Un se azɔn e wɛn wɛ é ɖe ɔ́, lobo jɛ te wá hwlɛ̌nhwlɛ́n ɛ gán gbé. Din ɔ́, wǎ. Un ná sɛ́ we dó Ejípu.’ "
"“This is the same Moses whom they had rejected with the words, ‘Who made you ruler and judge?’ He was sent to be their ruler and deliverer by God himself, through the angel who appeared to him in the bush. ","“Mɔyízi énɛ́ e yě kó gbɛ́, bó kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: ‘Mɛ̌ ká sɔ́ we gǎn, abǐ hwɛɖɔtɔ́’ a jí é wɛ Mawu wá sɛ́ dó yě, lobo ná ɛ hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n gbɔn wɛnsagun e tɔ́n dó jǐ tɔn ɖo zungodwe mɛ ɔ́ jí, nú é ná ɖu gǎn ɖo yě nu, lobo hwlɛ́n yě gán.

"He led them out of Egypt and did wonders and miraculous signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea and for forty years in the desert. ","Mɔyízi énɛ́ wɛ kplá Izlayɛ́li ví lɛ́ɛ tɔ́n sín Ejípu, gbɔn nǔdábaɖa e é ɖe tɔ́n lɛ́ɛ kpódó nǔ e é jlɛ́ ɖo to énɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ, bó jlɛ́ ɖo Xu Vɔvɔ ɔ́ tó, bó jlɛ́ ɖo gbětótló mɛ, káká xɔ xwe kanɖé (40) ɔ́ kpó gbla mɛ.

"“This is that Moses who told the Israelites, ‘God will send you a prophet like me from your own people.’ ",Mɔyízi ɖokpó énɛ́ wɛ ɖɔ nú Izlayɛ́li ví lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ jí: ‘Mawu ná bló bɔ gbeyíɖɔ nyɛ ɖɔhun ɖokpó ná tɔ́n ɖo togun mitɔn mɛ.’ 
"He was in the assembly in the desert, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers; and he received living words to pass on to us. ","Hwenu e togun ɔ́ kplé ɖo gbětótló mɛ ɔ́, é wɛ nɔ kpɔ́ xá yě; é nɔ kpɔ́ xá tɔ́gbó mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ, kpó wɛnsagun e ɖɔ xó n'i ɖo Sinayíi só jí ɔ́ kpó, bó yí Mawuxó e nɔ́ ná gbɛ mɛ ɔ́, bó ɖɔ nú mǐ. "
"“But our fathers refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt. ","“Lo ɔ́, tɔ́gbó mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ jló ná se tónú n'i ǎ, lobo gbɛ́ xó tɔn, bó jló ná lɛ́ kɔ yi Ejípu, "
"They told Aaron, ‘Make us gods who will go before us.

That was the time they made an idol in the form of a calf. They brought sacrifices to it and held a celebration in honor of what their hands had made. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, yě bló nyibúví ɖokpó hwenɛ́nu, bó jɛ vɔ̌sánú xwlé e jí, bɔ nǔ e yě ɖésú sɔ́ alɔ dó bló ná ɔ́, nyí awǎjijɛnú nú yě. "
"But God turned away and gave them over to the worship of the heavenly bodies. This agrees with what is written in the book of the prophets: “ ‘Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the desert, O house of Israel?

"“Our forefathers had the tabernacle of the Testimony with them in the desert. It had been made as God directed Moses, according to the pattern he had seen.

"Having received the tabernacle, our fathers under Joshua brought it with them when they took the land from the nations God drove out before them. It remained in the land until the time of David, ","Goxɔ énɛ́ wá jɛ tɔ́gbó mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ sí; bɔ Jozuwée nɔ yě nu, bɔ yě zé byɔ́ to e mɛ Mawu nya akɔta ɖé lɛ́ɛ sín, bɔ yě yi ɔ́ mɛ.

But it was Solomon who built the house for him. ,"Amɔ̌, axɔ́sú Salomɔ́ɔ wɛ wá gbá xɔ énɛ́ nú Mawu. "
"“However, the Most High does not live in houses made by men. As the prophet says: ","“Lo ɔ́, Mawu Ajalɔ̌nlɔn ɔ́ nɔ́ nɔ xɔ e gbɛtɔ́ gbá é mɛ ǎ, lě e gbeyíɖɔ tɔn ko ɖɔ gbɔn é; é ɖɔ: "

Has not my hand made all these things?’ ,Nyɛ wɛ bló nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ǎ cé?’ 
"“You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit! ","“Mi tamɛtitɔ́, tótlítɔ́, ayisyɛ́nsyɛ́nnɔ lɛ́ɛ mi; gǔ jɛ́n mi nɔ fɔ́n dó Yɛsinsɛn jí; nǔ e tɔ́gbó mitɔn lɛ́ɛ wa ɔ́, é wa wɛ jɛ́n mi lɔmɔ̌ ɖe. "
Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him– ,"Gbeyíɖɔ tɛ́ tɔ́gbó mitɔn lɛ́ɛ má ka dó ya ná ǎ? Yě hu mɛ e wá ɖɔ ɖ'ayǐ ɖɔ hwɛjijɔnɔ ɔ́ ná wá lɛ́ɛ é. Hwɛjijɔnɔ énɛ́ wɛ midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ mi sa, lobo hu din. "

"When they heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him. ","Ée toxóɖɔtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ se xó énɛ́ e Etyɛ́ni ɖɔ ɔ́, xomɛ sin yě dó wǔ tɔn tlala, bɔ yě jɛ aɖǔkún ɖu jí. "
"But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. ","Yɛsinsɛn gɔ́ ayi mɛ nú Etyɛ́ni, bɔ é kpɔ́n jǐxwé, bó mɔ susu Mawu tɔn, bɔ Jezu ɖo te ɖo ɖisíxwé nú Mawu, "

"At this they covered their ears and, yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed at him, ","Ée yě se mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě bǐ sú xó tlílí, bó sú tó, bó zɔn jǐ tɔn zɛ̌ɛ́n, "

"While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” ","Hwenu e yě ɖo awǐnnyaglo nyi dó Etyɛ́ni wɛ ɔ́, Etyɛ́ni xo ɖɛ, bó ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ Jezu, yǐ lǐndɔ̌n ce.” "
"Then he fell on his knees and cried out, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” When he had said this, he fell asleep.And Saul was there, giving approval to his death. On that day a great persecution broke out against the church at Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, é húzú jɛ kpo, bó sú xó tlílí ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ, ma lɛ́n hwɛ élɔ́ dó kɔ nú yě ó.” Ée é ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, é bɔnu.Etyɛ́ni e è hu ɔ́ nyɔ́ Sólu nukún mɛ.

Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him. ,"Mɛ e nɔ xwedó Mawusɛ́n ɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖěe ká sɔ́ Etyɛ́ni sín cyɔ yi ɖi, bó ya avǐ ɖésú. "
"But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison. ","Sólu ka nɔ́ ɖo gǎn dó wɛ, bó ná vívá agun Jezu tɔn. É nɔ gbɔn xwé gbe xwé gbe, bó nɔ́ wlí súnnu kpódó nyɔ̌nu kpán e ɖi nǔ nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ dó gankpá mɛ. "
Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went. ,Yě mɛ e gbadó lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ ɖo Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ jlá wɛ gbɔn fí lɛ́ɛ fí lɛ́ɛ. 
Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ there. ,"Mɔ̌ wɛ Filípu wá yi toxo ɖaxó ɖé mɛ ɖo Samalíi yíkúngban jí, bó nɔ́ ɖo Klísu xó ɖɔ wɛ. "
"When the crowds heard Philip and saw the miraculous signs he did, they all paid close attention to what he said. ","Ée togun ɔ́ se xó e ɖɔ wɛ Filípu ɖe lɛ́ɛ, bó ká mɔ nǔ e jlɛ́ wɛ é ɖe lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, yě mɛ bǐ sésé yí nǔkplɔ́nmɛ tɔn se. "
"With shrieks, evil spirits came out of many, and many paralytics and cripples were healed. ","Yɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ nɔ gosín azinzɔnnɔ gěgé jí kpó xósúsú ɖaxó kpó; mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, azɔn gbɔ nú wǔkúnánɔ gěgé, kpódó sékúnɔ gěgé kpán. "
So there was great joy in that city. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, xomɛ ɖaxó ɖé hun mɛ e ɖo to énɛ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ. "
"Now for some time a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great, ","Nya ɖé ká ɖo Samalíi to ɔ́ mɛ ɖ'ayǐ, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Sinmɔ́ɔ; nya énɛ́ nɔ́ ɖo majíki gěgé bló wɛ, bɔ é nɔ́ kpácá mɛ e ɖo Samalíi gbé jí lɛ́ɛ bǐ, bɔ é nɔ́ mɔ ɖɔ émí nyí nǔɖaxó, "

They followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic. ,"Yě bǐ nɔ́ ɖótó e tlítlí, ɖó nǔ e é nɔ́ jlɛ́ gbɔn majíki mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖo yě kpácá wɛ din ɔ́, é kó lín. "
"But when they believed Philip as he preached the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. ","Lo ɔ́, hwenu e yě yǐ Wɛn Ɖagbe e jlá yě wɛ Filípu ɖe dó axɔ́súɖuɖu Mawu tɔn kpódó nyǐkɔ Jezu Klísu tɔn kpó wú ɔ́ se ɔ́, è lɛ yɛhwesin nú yě, súnnu kpódó nyɔ̌nu kpó. "
"Simon himself believed and was baptized. And he followed Philip everywhere, astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw. ","Sinmɔ́ɔ lɔ ɖi nǔ, bɔ è lɛ yɛhwesin n'i; énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, é sɔ́ lɛ́ kɔ sín Filípu gúdo ǎ, bɔ nǔjlɛ́jlɛ́ kpódó nǔdábaɖa kpó e jlɛ́ wɛ Filípu nɔ ɖe lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ kpácá ɛ. "
"When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. ","Mɛsɛ́dó e ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu lɛ́ɛ wá se ɖɔ Samalíinu lɛ́ɛ ɖi nǔ nú xó ɔ́, bó sɛ́ Piyɛ́ɛ kpódó Jǎan kpán dó yě. "
"When they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, ","Ée yě jɛ to ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, yě xo ɖɛ nú nǔɖitɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, nú Mawu ná ná yě Yɛsinsɛn; "
because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them,Fon
"Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. ","Ée Piyɛ́ɛ kpódó Jǎan kpán xo ɖɛ gúdo ɔ́, yě ɖó alɔ yě jí, bɔ Mawu ná Yɛsinsɛn yě. "
"When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money ","Ée Sinmɔ́ɔ ka mɔ ɖɔ mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ ɖó alɔ nǔɖitɔ́ lɛ́ɛ jí, bɔ Mawu ná Yɛsinsɛn yě ɔ́, é dó akwɛ́ sín akpá nú yě, "
"and said, “Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.” ","bó ɖɔ: “Mi ná acɛ nyi lɔmɔ̌, bónú mɛ e jí un ná ɖó alɔ ɔ́, Mawu ná ná Yɛsinsɛn mɛ ɔ́.” "
"Peter answered: “May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money! ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Hwi kpódó akwɛ́ towe kpó bǐ ní bó dɔn, ɖó a lin ɖɔ è nɔ sɔ́ akwɛ́ dó xɔ nǔníná Mawu tɔn. "
"You have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right before God. ",Nǔɖé kan we ɖo xó élɔ́ mɛ ǎ
Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive you for having such a thought in your heart. ,"Hǔn, bo lɛ́ kɔ sín linlin towe nyanya énɛ́ gúdo, bó sa vo nú Aklúnɔ, bónú nǔ sixú nyí mɔ̌ ɔ́, é ná sɔ́ nǔ nyanya énɛ́ e a lin ɔ́ kɛ we; "
For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin.” ,"ɖó un mɔ ɖɔ nǔ dídá kɛ́ɖɛ́ wɛ gɔ́ ayi towe mɛ, bɔ hwɛ dó gɛdɛ we.” "
"Then Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me.” ","Sinmɔ́ɔ ka yí gbe ɖɔ jí: “Mi ɖésúnɔ mi bo sa vo nú Aklúnɔ nú mì, bónú nǔ e mi ɖɔ ɔ́ ɖě ma ɖi wǔ ce ó.” "
"When they had testified and proclaimed the word of the Lord, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages. ","Ée Piyɛ́ɛ kpódó Jǎan kpán ɖe kúnnu nú Aklúnɔ, bó jlá xó tɔn vɔ ɔ́, yě lɛ́ kɔ ɖidó Jeluzalɛ́mu, bó jlá Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ dó ali, gbɔn Samalíi sín gletoxo gěgé mɛ. "
"Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Go south to the road–the desert road–that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” ","Wɛnsagun Aklúnɔ tɔn ɖɔ nú Filípu ɖɔ jí: “A nǎ sí te, bó ɖidó to ɔ́ sín afɔligbé. Ali e gosín Jeluzalɛ́mu, bó gbɔn gbětótló mɛ yi Gaza ɔ́ wɛ a nǎ wlí.” "
"So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official in charge of all the treasury of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship, ","Filípu ka sí te, bó ɖidó. Nya agooɖojǐe Etiopíinu ɖé ka yi sɛn Mawu ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu, bó lɛ́ kɔ wá xwe xwé.

"The Spirit told Philip, “Go to that chariot and stay near it.” ",Yɛsinsɛn ka ɖɔ nú Filípu ɖɔ: “Xwedó kɛkɛ́ví énɛ́ wú.” 
Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. “Do you understand what you are reading?” Philip asked. ,"Filípu ka kán wezun bó xwedó kɛkɛ́ví ɔ́ wú, bó se nya Etiopíinu ɔ́ ɖo nǔ xa wɛ, ɖo gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn Ezayíi sín wěma mɛ lobo kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “A ka mɔ nǔ jɛ nǔ e xa wɛ a ɖe ɔ́ mɛ din a?” "
"“How can I,” he said, “unless someone explains it to me?” So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. ","Etiopíinu ɔ́ ká yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Ényí mɛɖé má tínmɛ nú mì ǎ ɔ́, nɛ̌ un ka sixú mɔ nǔ jɛ mɛ gbɔn?” É ka ɖɔ nú Filípu ɖɔ ní byɔ́ kɛkɛ́ví ɔ́ mɛ, bó jínjɔ́n akpá émítɔn. "
"The eunuch was reading this passage of Scripture: “He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth. ","Nǔ e xa wɛ é ɖe ɖo Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́ ɖíe: “È kplá ɛ lě e è nɔ kplá lɛ̌ngbɔ́ yi lanhutɛn ɔ́ ɖɔhun; é cí xwíí, lě e lɛ̌ngbɔ́ nɔ cí xwíí ɖo mɛ e ɖo fún kpa n'i wɛ ɔ́ nukɔn gbɔn é. "
In his humiliation he was deprived of justice. Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth.” ,"È dǒ winnyá ɛ, è táfú i, bó ɖɔ hwɛ tɔn ganjí ǎ. Mɛ̌ ka ná sixú kpi vǐ tɔn lɛ́ɛ sín tan? Đó yě hu i sín gbɛ élɔ́ mɛ.” "
"The eunuch asked Philip, “Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?” ","Nya agooɖojǐe ɔ́ ká kanbyɔ́ Filípu ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌ xó ɖɔ wɛ gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn ɔ́ ká ɖe? É ɖésú xó ɖɔ wɛ é ɖe a, abǐ mɛ ɖěvo? Kɛnklɛ́n, ɖɔ má se.” "
Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus. ,"Bɔ Filípu yí xó, bó bɛ́ sín nǔ e xa wɛ nya énɛ́ ɖe ɖo Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́ jí, bó ɖɔ Wɛn Ɖagbe Jezu tɔn ɔ́ sín xó n'i. "
"As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, “Look, here is water. Why shouldn't I be baptized?” ","Yě ɖo yiyi wɛ, bó wá yi mɔ sin ɖo fí ɖé, bɔ agooɖojǐe ɔ́ ɖɔ jí: “Kpɔ́n! Sin ɖíe; étɛ́ ka sɔ́ ná gbɛ́ ɖɔ un ma lɛ yɛhwesin ó?” [ "
And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him. ,"É zɔ́n bɔ è ɖǒ kɛkɛ́ví ɔ́ te, bɔ é kpódó Filípu kpó we lɛ́ɛ jɛ te, bó byɔ́ sin ɔ́ mɛ, bɔ Filípu lɛ yɛhwesin n'i. "
"When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing. ","Ée yě tɔ́n sín sin ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, Aklúnɔ sín Yɛ sɔ́ Filípu yi, bɔ agooɖojǐe ɔ́ sɔ́ mɔ ɛ ǎ. Lo ɔ́, é wlí ali tɔn, bó ɖidó kpódó xomɛhunhun kpó. "
"Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord's disciples. He went to the high priest ","Filípu ɔ́ ka wá mɔ éɖée ɖo to e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Azɔtɔ́si ɔ́ mɛ, bó wlí ali, bó nɔ́ ɖo Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ jlá wɛ gbɔn to lɛ́ɛ mɛ to lɛ́ɛ mɛ, káká yi jɛ Sezalée.Sólu ka kpo ɖo kúdán gblɔ́n nú Jezu sín ahwanvú lɛ́ɛ wɛ.

"and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem. ","bó ɖɔ ní bló wěma nú émí nú émí ná hɛn yi kplɔ́ngbasá e ɖo Damási lɛ́ɛ, bónú émí mɔ mɛ e byɔ́ sinsɛn yɔ̌yɔ́ ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖě ɔ́, súnnu abǐ nyɔ̌nu ɔ́, émí ná blá yě, bó kplá yě wá Jeluzalɛ́mu. "
"As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. ","Dɔ̌n ɔ́ yi wɛ é ɖe, bó kó sɛ yá Damási to ɔ́, bɔ tlóló ɔ́, wěziza ɖé gosín jǐxwé wá hɔ́n lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó e, "
"He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?” ","bɔ é jɛ ayǐ. É ka se gbe ɖé, bɔ gbe ɔ́ nɔ́ kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Sólu, Sólu, étɛ́wú a ka ɖo ya dó nú mì wɛ?” "
"“Who are you, Lord?” Saul asked. “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,” he replied. ",Sólu ka kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Hwi mɛ̌ ká wɛ Aklúnɔ?” Gbe ɔ́ ká ɖɔ: “Nyɛ Jezu e dó ya ná a ɖe ɔ́ wɛ.

The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless,Fon
"Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus. ","Sólu ka wá sí te sín kɔ́ mɛ, bó hun nukún, é ka sɔ́ sixú mɔ nǔ ɖěbǔ ǎ, bɔ yě hɛn alɔ tɔn, bó kplá ɛ byɔ́ Damási. "
"For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything. ",É nɔ nukúnnú ma mɔ nú azǎn atɔn. É ɖu nǔ ǎ
"In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, “Ananias!” “Yes, Lord,” he answered. ","Ahwanvú Jezu tɔn ɖokpó ka ɖo Damási fínɛ́, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Ananíyasi. É mɔ nǔ, bó mɔ Aklúnɔ bɔ é ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Ananíyasi.” Bɔ é yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Nyɛ ɖíe Aklúnɔ.” "
"The Lord told him, “Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying. ","Aklúnɔ ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Sí te, bó wlí ali e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ ali Jlɔ́jlɔ́ ɔ́, bó yi Judási xwé gbe, bó kan nya Táasinu e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Sólu ɔ́ byɔ́; é ɖo ɖɛ xo wɛ din; "
In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight.” ,"Sólu ɖo ɖɛ xo wɛ, bó mɔ nǔ, bó mɔ nya ɖé, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ nya ɔ́ ɖɔ Ananíyasi, bɔ é byɔ́ xwé gbe, bó ɖó alɔ jǐ tɔn, bónú é ná lɛ́ mɔ nǔ.” "
"“Lord,” Ananias answered, “I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem. ","Ananíyasi ka yí gbe ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ! Un ko se nya élɔ́ sín xó, ɖo mɛ gěgé nu. Nǔ nyanya e é wa xá mɛ e nyí towe ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, un se bǐ. "
And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.” ,"Fí e é ka wá din ɔ́, vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ wɛ é byɔ́ gbe, bó ná wlí mɛ e nɔ xomlá nyǐkɔ towe lɛ́ɛ bǐ.” "
"But the Lord said to Ananias, “Go! This man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before the Gentiles and their kings and before the people of Israel. ","Aklúnɔ ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Vɛ̌ yi, ɖó nya énɛ́ ɔ́, alǐnnyánú ɖé wɛ é nyí, bɔ un sɔ́, bó ná dó wa azɔ̌ ná, nú é ná jlá nyǐkɔ ce mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ, bó ná jlá axɔ́sú yětɔn lɛ́ɛ, kpódó Izlayɛ́li togun ɔ́ kpó. "
I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.” ,Un ka ná ɖe ya e é ná ji ɖó nyǐkɔ ce wú lɛ́ɛ bǐ xlɛ́ ɛ.” 
"Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord–Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here–has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.” ","Ananíyasi ka yi nǔgbó, bó byɔ́ xwé ɔ́ gbe, lobo ɖó alɔ Sólu jí, bó ɖɔ: “Sólu nɔví ce!

"Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized, ","Azɔn ɖokpó ɔ́, nǔ hwevízá ɖɔhun ɖé lɛ́ɛ jɛ ayǐ sín Sólu nukún jí, bɔ é lɛ́ jɛ nǔ mɔ jí bó sí te, bó lɛ yɛhwesin. "
"and after taking some food, he regained his strength. Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, é ɖu nǔ, bɔ hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n wá wǔ tɔn. Sólu nɔ ahwanvú Jezu tɔn e ɖo Damási lɛ́ɛ gɔ́n xɔ azǎn. "
At once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God. ,"É ka jɛ kplɔ́ngbasá lɛ́ɛ gbɔn jí azɔn ɖokpó, bó nɔ́ ɖo Jezu xó ɖɔ nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ, ɖɔ Mawu ví wɛ é nyí. "
"All those who heard him were astonished and asked, “Isn't he the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn't he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?” ","Nǔ énɛ́ kpácá mɛ e nɔ se xó e ɖɔ wɛ é ɖe lɛ́ɛ bǐ, bɔ yě nɔ́ ɖɔ: “Nya e ɖo mɛ e nɔ xomlá Jezu ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu lɛ́ɛ sín kún sú dó wɛ ɔ́ nɛ́ ǎ cé?

Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Christ. ,"Hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n e Sólu dó ɖo Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ jlá ná wɛ ɔ́ nɔ́ ɖo jijɛ jí wɛ, bɔ Jwifu e ɖo Damási lɛ́ɛ sɔ́ mɔ nu ɖé ná kɛ dó xó tɔn wú ǎ; ɖó é ɖe xlɛ́ titewungbe ɖɔ Jezu wɛ nyí Klísu. "
"After many days had gone by, the Jews conspired to kill him, ","Azǎn wá ɖo azǎn jí jɛ wɛ, bɔ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ yi kpá dó Sólu wú, bó ná hu i. "
but Saul learned of their plan. Day and night they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him. ,"Sólu se gbě e è blǎ dó wǔ tɔn ɔ́; zǎn kpó kéze kpó ɔ́, yě nɔ́ ɖo to ɔ́ sín hɔntogbó lɛ́ɛ jí, bó nɔ́ ɖo fí e é ná tɔ́n gbɔn ɔ́ cɔ́ wɛ, bó ná mɔ tɛn bo hu i. "
But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall. ,"Énɛ́ wú ɔ́, ahwanvú lɛ́ɛ wá sɔ́ ɛ dó xasun mɛ zǎn mɛ, bó sɔ́ ɛ gbɔn ahohó ɔ́ ta, bó ɖe e nyi te dǒ ɔ́ gúdo dɔ̌n. "
"When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple. ","Ée Sólu wá jɛ Jeluzalɛ́mu ɔ́, é jló ná xwe éɖée dó ahwanvú lɛ́ɛ mɛ; lo ɔ́, yě bǐ nɔ́ ɖi xɛsi dó wǔ tɔn, ɖó yě ɖeji ɖɔ élɔ́ ko húzú ahwanvú Klísu tɔn ǎ. "
"But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus. ","Baanabási ka kplá Sólu hɛn yi mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ gɔ́n, bó wlí lě e é mɔ Aklúnɔ gbɔn ɖo ali jí é, lě e Aklúnɔ ɖɔ xó n'i gbɔn é ɖɔ nú yě; é ɖɔ lě e Sólu ɖésú gbó adɔ bó jlá Mawuxó ɔ́ ɖo Jezu sín nyǐkɔ mɛ gbɔn, ɖo togun mɛ agbawungba ɖo Damási é bǐ nú yě. "
"So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. ","Bɛ́ sín hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, yě yí Sólu, bɔ é nɔ ɖo yiyi wɛ, bó nɔ́ ɖo wǐwá wɛ, bó nɔ́ gbó adɔ dó ɖɔ Mawuxó, ɖo Aklúnɔ nyǐkɔ mɛ, ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu. "
"He talked and debated with the Grecian Jews, but they tried to kill him. ","É nɔ́ ɖɔ xó nú Jwifu e nɔ xwedó walɔ Glɛ̌sinu lɛ́ɛ tɔn ɔ́ lɔmɔ̌, bó nɔ́ ɖo nǔ dɔn xá yě wɛ; amɔ̌, yě ɖo biba ná hu i wɛ. "
"When the brothers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus. ","Ée nɔví lɛ́ɛ se mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě kplá ɛ yi Sezalée, bó nyi i sɛ́ dó Táasi. "
"Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace. It was strengthened; and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it grew in numbers, living in the fear of the Lord. ","Yě mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ sín agun e ɖo Judée ɔ́ kpó ée ɖo Galilée ɔ́ kpó, kpódó ée ɖo Samalíi ɔ́ kpán bǐ sín ayi wɛ jɛ ayǐ, bɔ yě ɖo dǒ lí wɛ, bó nɔ́ ɖo sísí ɖó nú Aklúnɔ wɛ ɖo nǔwiwa yětɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ; Yɛsinsɛn gɔ́ alɔ nú yě, bɔ yě ɖo kpɔ́ sú d'é jí wɛ. "
"As Peter traveled about the country, he went to visit the saints in Lydda. ","Piyɛ́ɛ ɖo to ɔ́ bǐ mɛ gbɔn wɛ, lobo yi nǔɖitɔ́ e ɖo Lida lɛ́ɛ gɔ́n gbe ɖokpó. "
"There he found a man named Aeneas, a paralytic who had been bedridden for eight years. ","É mɔ nya ɖé ɖo fínɛ́, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Enɛ́ɛ; nya énɛ́ xwe ayǐsó ɖo zan jí din ɔ́, xwe tɔn ko yi tántɔn; bɔ é ɖo ayǐmlɔ́mlɔ́. "
"“Aeneas,” Peter said to him, “Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and take care of your mat.” Immediately Aeneas got up. ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Enɛ́ɛ, Jezu Klísu gbɔ azɔn nú we; sí te bó mlá zan towe.” Bɔ é sí te tlóló tɛn tɔn mɛ. "
All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord. ,"Lidanu lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpódó Calɔ́ni gbé jí nu lɛ́ɛ kpó ka mɔ nya énɛ́, bó húzú jɛ Aklúnɔ sín ali jí. "
"In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which, when translated, is Dorcas ), who was always doing good and helping the poor. ","Nyɔ̌nu ɖé ka ɖo ahwanvú Jezu tɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɖo Jopée, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Tabita; (nyǐkɔ énɛ́ sín tínmɛ wɛ nyí “Dɔ̌kási” ɖo Glɛ̌sigbe mɛ, bó nyí “Tɛ́” ɖo Fɔngbe mɛ.)

"About that time she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room. ","Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, é bɛ́ azɔn, lobo kú, bɔ yě lɛ wǔ nú cyɔ tɔn, bó sɔ́ yi tɛ́ ɖó xɔ ɖé mɛ, ɖo síngbó jí. "
"Lydda was near Joppa; so when the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two men to him and urged him, “Please come at once!” ","Ée ahwanvú Jezu tɔn e ɖo Jopée lɛ́ɛ se ɖɔ Piyɛ́ɛ ɖo Lida, bɔ Lida ma ka lín dó Jopée ǎ ɔ́, yě ɖe mɛ we sɛ́ dó e nú yě ní yi ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ ní kɛnklɛ́n bó wá kpɔ́n nǔ élɔ́ nú émí din tlóló. "
"Peter went with them, and when he arrived he was taken upstairs to the room. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them. ","Ée Piyɛ́ɛ se wɛn énɛ́ tlóló ɔ́, é sí te bó xwedó yě azɔn ɖokpó. Ée yě wá Jopée ɔ́, yě kplá ɛ yi xɔ ɔ́ mɛ, ɖo síngbó jí.

"Peter sent them all out of the room; then he got down on his knees and prayed. Turning toward the dead woman, he said, “Tabitha, get up.” She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up. ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka ɖe mɛ bǐ tɔ́n sín xɔ ɔ́ mɛ, bó húzú jɛ kpo, lobo xo ɖɛ, bó wá lílɛ́ kpan nukɔn cyɔ ɔ́, bó ɖɔ: “Tabita! Sí te!” Tabita ka hun nukún; ée é mɔ Piyɛ́ɛ ɔ́, é fɔ́n jínjɔ́n ayǐ. "
He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called the believers and the widows and presented her to them alive. ,"Piyɛ́ɛ ka hɛn alɔ tɔn, bó sɔ́ ɛ sí te, bó ylɔ́ nǔɖitɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, kpódó asúkúsi lɛ́ɛ kpán, bó sɔ́ ɛ xlɛ́ yě gbɛɖe. "
"This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord. ","Jopéenu lɛ́ɛ bǐ se nǔ énɛ́ ɔ́, bɔ yě mɛ gěgé ɖi nǔ nú Aklúnɔ. "
"Peter stayed in Joppa for some time with a tanner named Simon.At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment. ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka nɔ Jopée fínɛ́, ɖo anyǔzɔ́watɔ́ e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Sinmɔ́ɔ é xwé xɔ azǎn.Nya ɖé ɖo Sezalée, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Kɔnɛ́yi; sɔ́ja kanwekogán wɛ é nyí, ɖo ahwangbɛ́ e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Italíi tɔn ɔ́ mɛ. "
He and all his family were devout and God-fearing,Fon
"One day at about three in the afternoon he had a vision. He distinctly saw an angel of God, who came to him and said, “Cornelius!” ","Gbe ɖokpó wá su, ɖo hwelɛ́kɔ xwe gan atɔn mɛ mɔ̌, bɔ é mɔ nǔ, bó mɔ wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn ɖokpó céɖécéɖé, bɔ wɛnsagun ɔ́ byɔ́ xwé tɔn gbe, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Kɔnɛ́yi.” "
"Cornelius stared at him in fear. “What is it, Lord?” he asked. The angel answered, “Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God. ","Ée Kɔnɛ́yi mɔ wɛnsagun ɔ́, xɛsi jɛ jǐ tɔn; é ká kpɔ́n ɛ tlítlí, bó kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Nɛ̌ ká gbɔn Aklúnɔ?” Bɔ wɛnsagun ɔ́ yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Đɛ e a nɔ xo lɛ́ɛ, kpódó nǔ e a nɔ ná wamamɔnɔ lɛ́ɛ kpán ɔ́, bǐ wɛ Mawu yí, bó flín we. "
Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter. ,"Din ɔ́, sɛ́ mɛ dó Jopée, nú è yi ylɔ́ Sinmɔ́ɔ e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Piyɛ́ɛ ɔ́ wá. "
"He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.” ","É ɖo nya anyǔzɔ́watɔ́ ɖé xwé; è nɔ ylɔ́ nya ɔ́ ɖɔ Sinmɔ́ɔ, bɔ xwé tɔn ɖo xutó.” "
"When the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants. ","Ée wɛnsagun e ɖɔ xó n'i ɔ́ yi tlóló ɔ́, Kɔnɛ́yi ylɔ́ mɛsɛntɔ́ tɔn we, kpó sɔ́ja e nɔ wa azɔ̌ n'i lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó kpó; sɔ́ja énɛ́ nɔ́ xwedó Mawusɛ́n ɔ́; "
He told them everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa. ,"Kɔnɛ́yi tín nǔ e jɛ ɔ́ bǐ mɛ nú yě, lobo sɛ́ yě dó Jopée. "
"About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray. ","Ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn ɔ́, yě ɖo ali jí xweyǐgbe, bó kó sɛ yá Jopée. Đo Jopée dɔ̌n ɔ́, Piyɛ́ɛ xá xɔ ta hwenɛ́nu ɖo gan wěwe mɛ ɖɔhun mɔ̌, bó ná xo ɖɛ. "
"He became hungry and wanted something to eat, and while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance. ","Xovɛ́ sin i, bɔ é jló ná ɖu nǔ. Hwenu e è ɖo nǔɖuɖu ɔ́ bló wɛ ɔ́, é ba éɖée kpo, "
He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners. ,"bó mɔ jǐnukúnsin kɛ, bɔ nǔ avɔ ɖaxó ɖɔhun ɖé gosín jǐ ja dodomɛ, bɔ tó tɔn ɛnɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖo sinsin; "
"It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air. ","bɔ kanlin alɔkpa alɔkpa ɖ'é mɛ: ée nɔ́ zɔn afɔ ɛnɛ jí lɛ́ɛ, ée nɔ́ sá gbɔn kɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ, kpódó xɛ alɔkpa alɔkpa lɛ́ɛ kpán ɖ'é mɛ. "
"Then a voice told him, “Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.” ","É ká se gbe ɖé, bɔ gbe ɔ́ ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Piyɛ́ɛ! Sí te, hu, bó ɖu.” "
"“Surely not, Lord!” Peter replied. “I have never eaten anything impure or unclean.” ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka yí gbe ɖɔ jí: “Éeǒ Aklúnɔ; ɖó nǔ e nyí nǔvɛ́mɛ é kpódó nǔ e nɔ hɛn mɛ blí é kpó ɔ́, un ɖu ɖě kpɔ́n gbeɖé ǎ.” "
"The voice spoke to him a second time, “Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.” ","Gbe ɔ́ ká lɛ́ ɖɔ n'i azɔn wegɔ́ ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Nǔ e Mawu ɖɔ è hɛn ɔ́, è nǎ ɖu ɔ́, hwɛ ma ɖɔ é vɛ́ mɛ ó.” "
"This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven. ","Azɔn atɔn wɛ nǔ énɛ́ jɛ. Énɛ́ gúdo tlóló ɔ́, nǔ avɔ ɖaxó ɖɔhun ɔ́ kpódó nǔ e ɖ'é mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpán lɛ́ kɔ yi jǐxwé. "
"While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simon's house was and stopped at the gate. ","Piyɛ́ɛ ɖo nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ e é mɔ lɛ́ɛ sín tínmɛ kanbyɔ́ éɖée wɛ. Énɛ́ linkpɔ́n wɛ é ɖe kɛ́ɖɛ́, bɔ mɛ e Kɔnɛ́yi sɛ́ dó e lɛ́ɛ kan Sinmɔ́ɔ xwé byɔ́, bó wá jɛ hɔntogbó jí. "
"They called out, asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there. ","Yě zé gbe yi jǐ, bó kanbyɔ́ ɖɔ fínɛ́ wɛ Sinmɔ́ɔ e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Piyɛ́ɛ ɔ́ jɛ ají. "
"While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Simon, three men are looking for you. ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka kpo ɖo tamɛ lin dó nǔ e é mɔ ɔ́ wú wɛ, bɔ Yɛsinsɛn ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Đǒtó; mɛ atɔn ɖé lɛ́ɛ nɛ́ ɖo biba we wɛ nɛ́. "
"So get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.” ","Sí te, jɛ te, bó xwedó yě; ma xokpɔ́n ó, ɖó nyi wɛ sɛ́ yě dó.” "
"Peter went down and said to the men, “I'm the one you're looking for. Why have you come?” ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka jɛ te wá mɔ mɛ lɛ́ɛ, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Nyɛ mɛ e ba wɛ mi ɖe ɔ́ ɖíe; étɛ́ ka hɛn mi wá?” "
"The men replied, “We have come from Cornelius the centurion. He is a righteous and God-fearing man, who is respected by all the Jewish people. A holy angel told him to have you come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say.” ","Yě ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Sɔ́ja kanwekogán Kɔnɛ́yi wɛ sɛ́ mǐ dó; nya énɛ́ ɔ́, gbɛtɔ́ ɖagbe ɖé wɛ; é nɔ́ sí Mawu, bɔ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ bǐ nɔ́ ɖe kúnnu ɖagbe n'i.

"Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests. The next day Peter started out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went along. ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka kplá yě byɔ́ xwé gbe, lobo ɖó tɛnmɛ nú yě. Ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn ɔ́, é kpódó yě kpán wá jɛ ali; nɔví e ɖo Jopée lɛ́ɛ ɖě ka xwedó e. "
The following day he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. ,"Yě wá Sezalée ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn. Kɔnɛ́yi ka ɖo te kpɔ́n wǐwá yětɔn, bó ylɔ́ hɛ̌nnumɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ, kpódó xɔ́ntɔn tɔn vívɛ́ná lɛ́ɛ kpán. "
"As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence. ","Hwenu e Piyɛ́ɛ ɖo xwé ɔ́ gbe byɔ́ wɛ ɔ́, Kɔnɛ́yi wá kpé e, bó húzú jɛ kpo ɖo nukɔn tɔn, bó ɖe kɔ́. "
"But Peter made him get up. “Stand up,” he said, “I am only a man myself.” ","Lo ɔ́, Piyɛ́ɛ sɔ́ ɛ sí te, bó ɖɔ: “Sí te, gbɛtɔ́ wɛ nyɛ lɔmɔ̌ nyí.” "
"Talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people. ","Bɔ é kpódó Piyɛ́ɛ kpó jɛ xó ɖɔ jí, bó byɔ́ xwé ɔ́ gbe, bɔ Piyɛ́ɛ mɔ ɖɔ mɛ gěgé kó kplé ɖo fínɛ́, "
He said to them: “You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with a Gentile or visit him. But God has shown me that I should not call any man impure or unclean. ,"bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi tunwun ganjí ɖɔ, ɖo mǐ mɛ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ sín sɛ́n mɛ ɔ́, Jwifu ɖé kún ɖó ná dó gbɛ̌ xá mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ é gbeɖé ó; é kún ka ɖó ná byɔ́ ɖě xwé ó.

"So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?” ","Nǔ e wú wɛ hwenu e a ylɔ̌ mì ɔ́, un ma xokpɔ́n cóbó wá ǎ é nɛ́. Din ɔ́, nǔ e wú a ylɔ̌ mì ɔ́, bó ɖɔ nú mì.” "
"Cornelius answered: “Four days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me ","Kɔnɛ́yi ka yí xó, bó ɖɔ: “Azǎn ɛnɛ ɖíe wɛ un ɖo xwé ce gbe, ɖo gan atɔn mɛ hwelɛ́kɔ lěhwenu, bó ɖo ɖɛ xo wɛ; tlóló kpowun ɔ́, nya ɖé jɛ́n wá tɔ́n ɖo nukɔn ce, bó dó awu ɖé, bɔ awu ɔ́ nɔ́ kɔ́n. "
"and said, ‘Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor. ","Nya ɔ́ ɖɔ nú mì ɖɔ: ‘Kɔnɛ́yi, Mawu yí ɖɛ towe, bó flín nǔ e a nɔ ná wamamɔnɔ lɛ́ɛ é. "
"Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.’ ","Sɛ́ mɛ dó Jopée, nú è yi ylɔ́ Sinmɔ́ɔ e è nɔ lɛ́ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Piyɛ́ɛ é wá. Anyǔzɔ́watɔ́ Sinmɔ́ɔ e xwé tɔn ɖo xutó ɔ́ sín xwé gbe wɛ é jɛ.’ "
"So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.” ","Un ka sɛ́ mɛ dó azɔn ɖokpó, ɖɔ è nǐ yi ylɔ́ we wá, bɔ a ka yí gbe bo wá nǔgbó.

Then Peter began to speak: “I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism ,"Piyɛ́ɛ yí xó, bó ɖɔ: “Un mɔ din nǔgbó ɖɔ Mawu kún nɔ́ ɖe mɛɖé ɖó vo ɖo mɛɖé mɛ ó. "
but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right. ,"Lo ɔ́, ɖo akɔta ɖěbǔ mɛ ɔ́, mɛ e nɔ ɖó sísí n'i, bó nɔ́ xwedó hwɛjijɔ ɔ́, mɛ énɛ́ sín nǔ nɔ́ nyɔ́ nukún tɔn mɛ. "
"You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, telling the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all. ","Mi tunwun xó e Mawu ɖɔ sɛ́ dó Izlayɛ́li ví lɛ́ɛ, bó dó Wɛn Ɖagbe e nɔ ná fífá mɛ ɔ́ yě gbɔn Jezu Klísu e nyí mɛ bǐ sín Aklúnɔ ɔ́ jí é. "
"You know what has happened throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached– ","Hwenu e Jǎan jlá Mawuxó ɔ́, bó lɛ yɛhwesin nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ gúdo ɔ́, mi tunwun nǔ e jɛ ɖo Galilée hwɛ̌ cóbó lɛ́ wá jɛ gbɔn Judée gbé ɔ́ bǐ jí é. "
"how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.

"“We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a tree, ","Nǔ e é wa ɖo Jwifu lɛ́ɛ yíkúngban jí, kpódó Jeluzalɛ́mu kpó ɔ́ bǐ wɛ mǐ mɔ; yě ká ɛ nyi aklúzu jí, bó hu i. "
but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. ,"Mawu ka fɔ́n ɛ sín kú azǎn tɔn atɔngɔ́ ɔ́ gbe, bó ɖe e xlɛ́. "
"He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen–by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. ","Togun ɔ́ bǐ wɛ é ka ɖe e xlɛ́ ǎ; lo ɔ́, mǐ mɛ e Mawu kó cyán ɖ'ayǐ, bɔ mǐ ná nyí kúnnuɖetɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ wɛ é ɖe e xlɛ́; mǐ ɖu nǔ, bó nu ahan xá ɛ hwenu e Mawu fɔ́n ɛ sín kú wá gbɛ é gúdo. "
He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. ,"É ka zɔ́n ɖɔ mǐ ní jlá togun ɔ́ bǐ, bó ɖe kúnnu ná ɖɔ émí wɛ nyí mɛ e Mawu sɔ́ bɔ é ná ɖɔ hwɛ xá mɛ e ɖo gbɛ kpó mɛ e ko kú lɛ́ɛ kpó é. "
All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.” ,"É wɛ gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɖe kúnnu ná ɖɔ jí: ‘Mɛ e ná ɖi nǔ n'i lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, Mawu ná sɔ́ hwɛ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ kɛ yě, gbɔn hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n e Jezu sín nyǐkɔ ɖó ɔ́ gbla mɛ.’ ” "
"While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. ","Piyɛ́ɛ kpo ɖo xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ wɛ, bɔ Yɛsinsɛn jɛ te wá mɛ e ɖo tó ɖó e wɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ jí. "
The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. ,"Ée Jwifu e ɖi nǔ nú Jezu, bó xwedó Piyɛ́ɛ wá lɛ́ɛ mɔ ɖɔ Yɛsinsɛn e Mawu nɔ́ ná mɛ ɔ́ gba kɔn nyi mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌ jí ɔ́, é kpácá yě tlala. "
"For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said, ","Đó yě se bɔ yě ɖo xó ɖɔ wɛ dó gbe e yě ma se ǎ lɛ́ɛ mɛ, bó ɖo susu kpa nú Mawu wɛ. Piyɛ́ɛ ka yí xó, bó ɖɔ: "
“Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.” ,"“Mɛ élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ e Mawu ná Yɛsinsɛn lě e é ná mǐ lɔmɔ̌ gbɔn ɔ́, è sixú gbɛ́ ɖɔ è ma lɛ yɛhwesin nú yě kpó sin kpó ó a?” "
So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.The apostles and the brothers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. ,"Ée é ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, é ná gbe ɖɔ è lɛ yɛhwesin nú yě, ɖo Jezu Klísu nyǐkɔ mɛ.

"So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him ","Énɛ́ wú wɛ hwenu e Piyɛ́ɛ lɛ́ kɔ yi Jeluzalɛ́mu ɔ́, Jwifu klísusɛntɔ́ lɛ́ɛ dó hwɛ ɛ, "

Peter began and explained everything to them precisely as it had happened: ,"Piyɛ́ɛ ka yí xó, bó tín lě e nǔ lɛ́ɛ yi gbɔn ɔ́ mɛ nú yě ɖokpó ɖokpó; "
"“I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was.

"I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the air. ","bɔ un jɛ kpínkpɔ́n jí tlítlí, bó mɔ kanlin e nɔ zɔn afɔ ɛnɛ jí lɛ́ɛ, gběkanlin lɛ́ɛ, kanlin e nɔ sá gbɔn kɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ, kpódó xɛ alɔkpa alɔkpa lɛ́ɛ kpó ɖ'é mɛ. "
"Then I heard a voice telling me, ‘Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.’ ","Un ka se gbe ɖé, bɔ é ɖɔ nú mì ɖɔ: ‘Piyɛ́ɛ, sí te, hu bo ɖu.’ "
"“I replied, ‘Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’ ","Un ka yí gbe ɖɔ jí: ‘Éeǒ Aklúnɔ! Đó nǔ e nyí su é kpódó nǔ e nɔ hɛn mɛ blí é kpó ɔ́, un ɖu ɖě kpɔ́n gbeɖé ǎ.’ "
"“The voice spoke from heaven a second time, ‘Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.’ ","Gbe ɔ́ ka lɛ́ ɖɔ nú mì sín jǐxwé azɔn wegɔ́ ɔ́ ɖɔ: ‘Nǔ e Mawu ɖɔ è hɛn ɔ́, è nǎ ɖu ɔ́, hwɛ ma ɖɔ é vɛ́ mɛ ó.’ "
"This happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again. ","Azɔn atɔn wɛ nǔ énɛ́ jɛ; énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, nǔ avɔ ɖaxó ɖɔhun ɔ́ kpódó nǔ e ɖ'é mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpó yi jǐxwé. "
“Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying. ,"Hwenɛ́nu tlóló ɔ́, mɛ atɔn ɖé lɛ́ɛ wá xwé e gbe un ɖe ɔ́ sín hɔn jí; Sezalée wɛ è sɛ́ yě dó sín. "
"The Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man's house. ","Yɛsinsɛn ka ɖɔ ma xwedó yě; nyɛ ní má xo kpɔ́n ó. Nɔví mǐtɔn ayizɛ́n élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ e mɔ wɛ mi ɖe din lɛ́ɛ ká kplá mì yi Sezalée, bɔ mǐ bǐ byɔ́ Kɔnɛ́yi xwé, "
"He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say, ‘Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. ","bɔ nya ɔ́ wlí lě e é mɔ wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn ɖé wá xwé tɔn gbe, bó ɖɔ xó n'i gbɔn ɔ́ ɖɔ nú mǐ; wɛnsagun ɔ́ ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: ‘Sɛ́ mɛ dó Jopée nú è yi ylɔ́ Sinmɔ́ɔ e nɔ lɛ́ nyí Piyɛ́ɛ é wá. "
He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.’ ,É ná ɖɔ xó e ná hwlɛ́n hwi kpódó hɛ̌nnu towe bǐ kpó gán ɔ́ nú we.’ 
"“As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning. ","Xó ɖɔ nú yě jí wɛ un jɛ, bɔ Yɛsinsɛn jɛ te wá yě jǐ, lě e é jɛ te wá mǐ jǐ ɖo bǐbɛ́mɛ gbɔn é, "
"Then I remembered what the Lord had said: ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’ ",bɔ un flín xó e Aklúnɔ kó ɖɔ ɔ́
"So if God gave them the same gift as he gave us, who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could oppose God?” ","Ényí Mawu ná nǔníná ɖokpó ɔ́ yě, lě e é ná mǐ lɔ gbɔn hwenu e mǐ ɖi nǔ nú Aklúnɔ Jezu Klísu ɔ́, mɛ̌ nyɛ ka nyí, bó ná yi gbɛ́ gbe nú Mawu.” "
"When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, “So then, God has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life.” ","Ée yě se mɔ̌ ɔ́, xomɛ yětɔn fá, bɔ yě jɛ susu kpa nú Mawu jí, bó nɔ́ ɖɔ: “Mawu bló, bɔ mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌ sixú lɛ́ kɔ sín hwɛ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ gúdo, bó ná sixú mɔ gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ.” "
"Now those who had been scattered by the persecution in connection with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, telling the message only to Jews. ","Yadónúmɛ e tíin hwenu e è hu Etyɛ́ni ɔ́ zɔ́n bɔ mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ gbadó.

"
"Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus. ","Amɔ̌, Cíplunu kpódó Silenɛ́ɛnu ɖé lɛ́ɛ kpán ka ɖo yě mɛ, bɔ hwenu e yě yi Antyɔ́ci ɔ́, yě jɛ Wɛn Ɖagbe Aklúnɔ Jezu tɔn sín xó jlá Glɛ̌sinu lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌ jí. "
"The Lord's hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord. ","Aklúnɔ sín hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n ɖo kpɔ́ xá yě, bɔ mɛ gěgé ɖi nǔ, bó húzú jɛ Aklúnɔ li jí. "
"News of this reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. ","Nǔ énɛ́ wá yi jɛ tó mɛ nú agun Jezu tɔn e ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu ɔ́, bɔ yě sɛ́ Baanabási dó Antyɔ́ci. "
"When he arrived and saw the evidence of the grace of God, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts. ","Ée é wá, bó mɔ lě e Mawu wa ɖagbe nú togun ɔ́ gbɔn ɔ́, é hun xomɛ n'i, bɔ é ná akɔ́nkpinkpan yě bǐ, ɖɔ yě ní nɔ gbejí nú Aklúnɔ kpó ayixa ɖokpó kpó. "
"He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord. ","Đó Banabási ɔ́, ɖagbewatɔ́ wɛ, bɔ Yɛsinsɛn kpódó nǔɖiɖi kpán gɔ́ ayi tɔn mɛ, bɔ mɛ gěgé lɛ́ jɛ Aklúnɔ sín ali jí. "
"Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, ","Énɛ́ gúdo ɔ́, Baanabási yi to e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Táasi ɔ́ mɛ, bó ná yi kplá Sólu. "
"and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch. ","Ée é mɔ ɛ ɔ́, é kplá ɛ wá Antyɔ́ci, bɔ yě mɛ we lɛ́ɛ bló xwe ɖokpó kpíkpé ɖo agun mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ tɔn e ɖo fínɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ, bó kplɔ́n nǔ mɛ gěgé.

During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. ,"Hwe énɛ́ nu ɔ́, gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn ɖé lɛ́ɛ gosín Jeluzalɛ́mu, bó yi Antyɔ́ci. "
"One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.) ","Mɛ e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Agabusi ɖo yě mɛ ɔ́ sí te, bɔ Yɛsinsɛn sɔ́ dó ayi mɛ n'i bɔ é ɖɔ adɔ ɖaxó ɖé ná wá tɔ́n ɖo ayǐkúngban ɔ́ bǐ jí. (Adɔ énɛ́ ka tɔ́n nǔgbó hwenu e Klódu ɖo axɔ́sú ɖu wɛ é.) "
"The disciples, each according to his ability, decided to provide help for the brothers living in Judea. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, ahwanvú lɛ́ɛ ɖe gbeta tɔ́n, ɖɔ émí ɖokpó ɖokpó ná ná nǔ e wú émí kpé ɔ́, bɔ è nǎ sɛ́ dó nɔví émítɔn ɖo Klísu mɛ e ɖo Judée lɛ́ɛ, bó dó dó alɔ yě ná. "
"This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.It was about this time that King Herod arrested some who belonged to the church, intending to persecute them. ","Yě sɛ́ nǔ e yě jɔ lɛ́ɛ dó agunnukɔntɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖo Judée, gbɔn Baanabási kpódó Sólu kpó jí.Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, axɔ́sú Elódu jɛ ya dó nú mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ jí, ɖo agunví lɛ́ɛ mɛ. "
"He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword. ",É zɔ́n bɔ è zě hwǐ dó hu Jaki e nyí Jǎan sín nɔví é ná. 
"When he saw that this pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. This happened during the Feast of Unleavened Bread. ","Ée é mɔ ɖɔ nǔ énɛ́ nyɔ́ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ nukún mɛ ɔ́, é zɔ́n, bɔ è wlǐ Piyɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌. (Wɔ̌xúxú e mɛ è ma dó tɔ́n ǎ é sín xwezán hwenu wɛ.) "
"After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover. ","Ée Elódu wlí Piyɛ́ɛ ɔ́, é sú i dó gankpá mɛ, bó sɔ́ ɛ dó alɔ mɛ nú sɔ́ja ɛnɛ ɛnɛ gbɛ́ donu ɛnɛ, nú yě ná cɔ́ ɛ, bó ɖo linlin wɛ ɖɔ Dǐndínwáyixwe ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, émí ná dɔn ɛ wá togun ɔ́ nukɔn, bó ná ɖɔ hwɛ xá ɛ. "
"So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him. ","Lo ɔ́, hwenu e Piyɛ́ɛ ɖo ganxó ɔ́, agun ɔ́ nɔ́ ɖo ɖɛ xo wɛ syɛ́nsyɛ́n dó ta tɔn mɛ. "
"The night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries stood guard at the entrance. ","Ée é kpo sɔ bɔ Elódu ná kplá Piyɛ́ɛ wá togun ɔ́ nukɔn, bó ná ɖɔ hwɛ xá ɛ ɔ́, Piyɛ́ɛ ɖo amlɔ dɔ́ wɛ zǎn mɛ, ɖo sɔ́ja we tɛ́ntin; wlɔ we wɛ è dó e, bɔ sɔ́ja ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ ka ɖo te ɖo hɔn ɔ́ jí, bó ɖo gankpá ɔ́ cɔ́ wɛ. "
"Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up. “Quick, get up!” he said, and the chains fell off Peter's wrists. ","Azɔn ɖokpó ɔ́, wɛnsagun Aklúnɔ tɔn ɖokpó wá xwetɔ́n, bɔ wěziza hɔ́n ɖo xɔ ɔ́ mɛ. Wɛnsagun ɔ́ ka ɖó alɔ Piyɛ́ɛ wú, bó fɔ́n ɛ, lobo ɖɔ: “Sí te hawun!” Bɔ wlɔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ jɛ ayǐ sín alɔ tɔn. "
"Then the angel said to him, “Put on your clothes and sandals.” And Peter did so. “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me,” the angel told him. ","Wɛnsagun ɔ́ ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Sɔ́ gǒjíblánú towe sin, bó sɔ́ afɔkpa towe lɛ́ɛ dó.” Bɔ é ka bló gbɔn mɔ̌. Wɛnsagun ɔ́ ka lɛ́ ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Sɔ́ awu towe ɖaxó ɔ́ dó, bó xwedó mì.” "
"Peter followed him out of the prison, but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening; he thought he was seeing a vision. ","Bɔ Piyɛ́ɛ tɔ́n, bó xwedó wɛnsagun ɔ́; lo ɔ́, nǔ e wa wɛ wɛnsagun ɔ́ ɖe ɔ́, Piyɛ́ɛ ɖi ɖɔ nǔgbó wɛ é nyí ǎ; é vɛdó ɖɔ nǔ mɔ wɛ émí ɖe sín. "
"They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city. It opened for them by itself, and they went through it. When they had walked the length of one street, suddenly the angel left him. ","Yě zɛ sɔ́ja nukɔn tɔn lɛ́ɛ wú, bó zɛ wegɔ́ lɛ́ɛ wú, bó yi jɛ ganhɔn e tɔ́n jɛ toxo mɛ ɔ́ jí, bɔ hɔn ɔ́ nɔ é ɖóɖó, bó hun ɖo nukɔn yětɔn, bɔ yě tɔ́n, bó mlɛ́ ali ɖé ɖidó; azɔn ɖokpó ɔ́, wɛnsagun ɔ́ ka jó e dó. "
"Then Peter came to himself and said, “Now I know without a doubt that the Lord sent his angel and rescued me from Herod's clutches and from everything the Jewish people were anticipating.” ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka mɔ éɖée mɛ, bó ɖɔ: “Un mɔ ganjí din ɖɔ Aklúnɔ wɛ sɛ́ wɛnsagun tɔn dó, bó wá xɔ mì ɖo Elódu kpódó nǔ e nɔ te kpɔ́n wɛ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ɖe ɔ́ bǐ kpó sí.” "
"When this had dawned on him, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, also called Mark, where many people had gathered and were praying. ","Ée é mɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, é ɖidó Mali e nyí Jǎan e è nɔ lɛ́ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Maki ɔ́ sín nɔ xwé. Mɛ gěgé ko kplé ɖo fínɛ́, bó ɖo ɖɛ xo wɛ. "
"Peter knocked at the outer entrance, and a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer the door. ","É xúxú hɔntogbó, bɔ nyɔ̌nu mɛsɛntɔ́ e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Hlodu ɔ́ wá kpɔ́n mɛ e ɖo hɔn xúxú wɛ é. "
"When she recognized Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed she ran back without opening it and exclaimed, “Peter is at the door!” ","Ée é se mɛ ɔ́ sín gbe ɔ́, é tunwun ɖɔ Piyɛ́ɛ wɛ, bɔ xomɛ hun i káká, bɔ é sɔ́ hun hɔn ɔ́ ǎ, bó kán wezun yi ɖɔ Piyɛ́ɛ wɛ ɖo te ɖo hɔn ɔ́ jí. "
"“You're out of your mind,” they told her. When she kept insisting that it was so, they said, “It must be his angel.” ","Yě ka ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “A ɖo lugbe ǎ.” Lo ɔ́, Hlodu lɛ́ vɔ́ tɛ ɖɛ̌ jí bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ nǔgbó ɖɔ nú yě wɛ émí ɖe; yě ka ɖɔ: “Sɛ́ tɔn wɛ.” "
"But Peter kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished. ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka kpo ɖo hɔn xúxú wɛ jɛ́n wɛ; ée yě wá yi hun hɔn ɔ́, yě mɔ ɛ, bɔ ado hu yě. "
"Peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet and described how the Lord had brought him out of prison. “Tell James and the brothers about this,” he said, and then he left for another place. ","Piyɛ́ɛ ka bló alɔ nú yě ɖɔ yě ní xwɛ, bó wlí lě e Aklúnɔ ɖe e sín gankpá mɛ gbɔn ɔ́ ɖɔ nú yě.

"In the morning, there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter. ","Ée ayǐ wá hɔ́n ɔ́, sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ jɛ jojo dán jí, bó nɔ́ kanbyɔ́ yěɖée ɖɔ: “Étɛ́ ka jɛ dó Piyɛ́ɛ jí?” "
"After Herod had a thorough search made for him and did not find him, he cross-examined the guards and ordered that they be executed. Then Herod went from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there a while. ","Elódu yi Piyɛ́ɛ kplá gbé ɖo gankpá mɛ, bó ba ɛ kpo, bó ylɔ́ sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ, bó kan nǔ byɔ́ yě, lobo ná gbe ɖɔ è nǐ hu yě. Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, Elódu gosín Judée, bó yi nɔ Sezalée. "
"He had been quarreling with the people of Tyre and Sidon; they now joined together and sought an audience with him. Having secured the support of Blastus, a trusted personal servant of the king, they asked for peace, because they depended on the king's country for their food supply. ","Elódu sin xomɛ dó Tíinu lɛ́ɛ kpódó Sidɔ́ɔnnu lɛ́ɛ kpán tlala.

"On the appointed day Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people. ","Ée kplézán ɔ́ sɔgbe ɔ́, Elódu dó axɔ́súwu tɔn lɛ́ɛ, bó jínjɔ́n axɔ́súzinkpo tɔn jí, bó ɖɔ xó nú yě agbawungba, "
"They shouted, “This is the voice of a god, not of a man.” ",bɔ to ɔ́ bǐ nɔ́ sú xó ɖɔ: “Gbɛtɔ́ wɛ ɖo xó ɖɔ wɛ ǎ
"Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died. ","Lo ɔ́, tlóló tɛn tɔn mɛ ɔ́, wɛnsagun Aklúnɔ tɔn sín alɔ jɛ wǔ tɔn, ɖó é sɔ́ Mawu su ǎ wútu; bɔ wě ɖu i káká bɔ é kú. "
But the word of God continued to increase and spread. ,Mawuxó ɔ́ ká ɖo gbigba kpé d'é jí wɛ. 
"When Barnabas and Saul had finished their mission, they returned from Jerusalem, taking with them John, also called Mark.In the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch) and Saul. ","Baanabási kpódó Sólu kpán ka wa nǔ e gbé è sɛ́ yě dó é ɖó alɔ te, bó lɛ́ kɔ sín Jeluzalɛ́mu, bó kplá Jǎan e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Maki é.Đo mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ sín agun e ɖo Antyɔ́ci ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, è nɔ mɔ gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ, kpódó nǔkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpó: Baanabási, Simɛ́nyɔ́ɔ e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Mɛwi é, Lusiwúsi Silenɛ́ɛnu ɔ́, Manayɛnu e Elódu tokpɔngán ɔ́ sín mɛ lɛ́ɛ hɛn, bɔ é kpó é kpó nɔ kpɔ́ bó su é, kpódó Sólu kpán.

"While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” ","Gbe ɖokpó ka wá su bɔ yě ɖo Aklúnɔ sɛn wɛ, bó ɖo nu blá wɛ, bɔ Yɛsinsɛn ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi ɖe Baanabási kpódó Sólu kpán ɖó vo nú mì, nú yě ná yi wa azɔ̌ e wú un ylɔ́ yě é.” "

"The two of them, sent on their way by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus. ","Ée Yɛsinsɛn sɛ́ Baanabási kpódó Sólu kpán dó mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě wá yi Selesíi, bó dó tɔjíhún ɖo fínɛ́ ɖidó to e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Cíplu ɔ́ mɛ. "
"When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. John was with them as their helper. ","Đěe yě jɛ to e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Salamínu ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, yě yi kplɔ́ngbasá Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn, bó jɛ Mawuxó jlá jí, bɔ Jǎan-Maki ɖo yě gɔ́n, bó ná dó alɔ yě. "
"They traveled through the whole island until they came to Paphos. There they met a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus, ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, yě xo tɔtɛ́ntinto ɔ́ bǐ zlɛ́ káká yi jɛ to e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Pafɔ́si ɔ́ mɛ; yě mɔ Jwifu majíkiblótɔ́ ɖé ɖo fínɛ́, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Báa-Jezu, bɔ é sɔ́ éɖée dó ɖó gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn.

"who was an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. The proconsul, an intelligent man, sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God.

But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is what his name means) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith. ,"lo ɔ́, Elimasi e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ majíkiblótɔ́ ɔ́, (mɔ̌ wɛ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ dó Glɛ̌sigbe mɛ) ka ná tɛn tɔn yě ǎ, é ɖo biba ná ɖe ayi tokpɔngán ɔ́ tɔn sín nǔɖiɖi ɖó nú Jezu Klísu xó e ɖɔ n'i wɛ è ɖe ɔ́ wú wɛ.

"Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight at Elymas and said, ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, Sólu e è nɔ lɛ́ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Pɔ́lu ɔ́, Yɛsinsɛn gɔ́ ayi mɛ n'i, bɔ é kpɔ́n Elimasi tlítlí, "
“You are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right! You are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery.

"Now the hand of the Lord is against you. You are going to be blind, and for a time you will be unable to see the light of the sun.” Immediately mist and darkness came over him, and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand. ","Din ɔ́, ɖǒtó! Aklúnɔ ná dɔn tó nú we; a nǎ va nukún, bó ná gɔn hwesivɔ́ mɔ káká yi jɛ hwe ɖé nu.” Tlóló tɛn tɔn mɛ ɔ́, Elimasi va nukún, bó jɛ avi dlá jí, lobo ɖo mɛ e ná kplá ɛ ɔ́ ba wɛ. "
"When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was amazed at the teaching about the Lord. ","Ée tokpɔngán ɔ́ mɔ nǔ énɛ́ e jɛ ɔ́, é ɖi nǔ nú Jezu, ɖó nǔ e è kplɔ́n ɛ dó Aklúnɔ wú ɔ́ xo ayi tɔn zlɛ́. "
"From Paphos, Paul and his companions sailed to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them to return to Jerusalem. ","Pɔ́lu kpódó hǎgbɛ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpán ka wá dó tɔjíhún sín Pafɔ́si, bó yi jɛ Pɛɛjée ɖo Panfilíi gbé jí. Jǎan-Maki ka jó yě dó ɖo fínɛ́, bó lɛ́ kɔ yi Jeluzalɛ́mu. "
From Perga they went on to Pisidian Antioch. On the Sabbath they entered the synagogue and sat down. ,"Yědɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ka zɛ Pɛɛjée wú, bó yi Antyɔ́ci ɖo Pisidíi gbé jí; yě byɔ́ kplɔ́ngbaságbɔjɛzán gbe, bó jínjɔ́n ayǐ. "
"After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue rulers sent word to them, saying, “Brothers, if you have a message of encouragement for the people, please speak.” ","Hwenu e yě xa sɛ́n ɔ́, bó xa gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ sín wěma gúdo ɔ́, kplɔ́ngbaságán lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ sɛ́ dó yě ɖɔ: “Nɔví mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ mi, ényí mi ɖó xó ɖé, bó ná ɖɔ nú togun ɔ́, bó dó ná ɛ akɔ́nkpinkpan hǔn, mi ɖɔ.” "

he overthrew seven nations in Canaan and gave their land to his people as their inheritance. ,"É ka wá vívá kún nú akɔta tɛ́nwe, ɖo Kanáa yíkúngban jí, bó sɔ́ to yětɔn nú Izlayɛ́li ví lɛ́ɛ, bɔ ayǐkúngban énɛ́ húzú yětɔn. "
"All this took about 450 years. “After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet. ","“Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, é sɔ́ gǎn lɛ́ɛ ɖó yě nu, nú xwe afɔwe kanɖé wǒ (450) mɔ̌ káká yi jɛ gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn Samuwɛ́li hwenu. "
"Then the people asked for a king, and he gave them Saul son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled forty years. ","Yě ɖésúnɔ ka wá byɔ́ axɔ́sú ɖokpó, bɔ Mawu sɔ́ Sawúlu Kícu sín vǐ ɔ́, ɖo Bɛnjamɛ́ɛ ví lɛ́ɛ mɛ, bɔ é ɖu axɔ́sú ɖo yě nu xɔ xwe kanɖé (40). "
"After removing Saul, he made David their king. He testified concerning him: ‘I have found David son of Jesse a man after my own heart; he will do everything I want him to do.’ ","Énɛ́ gúdo ɔ́, Mawu wá ɖe Sawúlu sín axɔ́súzinkpo jí, bó sɔ́ Davídi ɖó tɛn tɔn mɛ.

"“From this man's descendants God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus, as he promised. ","Vǐ tɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ wɛ Jezu e Mawu sɔ́ Mɛhwlɛ́ngántɔ́ nú togun Izlayɛ́li tɔn ɔ́ tɔ́n sín, lě e é dó akpá tɔn nú yě gbɔn é. "
"Before the coming of Jesus, John preached repentance and baptism to all the people of Israel. ","Cóbónú Jezu ná wá ɔ́, Jǎan ko ɖɔ nú Izlayɛ́li togun ɔ́ bǐ ɖɔ yě ní lɛ́ kɔ sín hwɛ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ gúdo, bó lɛ yɛhwesin. "
"As John was completing his work, he said: ‘Who do you think I am? I am not that one. No, but he is coming after me, whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.’ ","Hwenu e Jǎan ka wá ɖo azɔ̌ tɔn ná wa fó wɛ ɔ́, é nɔ ɖɔ jí: ‘Mɛ̌ un ka nyí bɔ mi vɛdó?

"“Brothers, children of Abraham, and you God-fearing Gentiles, it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent. ","“Nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, mi mɛ e jɔ ɖo Ablaxámu kúnkan mɛ lɛ́ɛ, kpódó mi mɛ e nɔ sí Mawu lɛ́ɛ kpán e mi; mi wɛ Mawu dó Wɛn Ɖagbe élɔ́ e nɔ hwlɛ́n mɛ gán ɔ́ sɛ́ dó. "
"The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in condemning him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath. ","Đó Jeluzalɛ́munu lɛ́ɛ kpódó gǎn yětɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó tunwun mɛ e Jezu nyí ɔ́ ǎ; yě ka mɔ nukúnnú jɛ gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ sín nǔ e è nɔ xa nú yě gbɔjɛzán gbe tɛgbɛ ɔ́ wú ǎ; lo ɔ́, kúhwɛ e yě ɖǒ nú Jezu ɔ́, nǔ e è nɔ xa nú yě ɔ́ wɛ jɛ.

"Though they found no proper ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him executed. ","Yě mɔ nǔɖé wú ná ɖó dó, bó dó ɖó kúhwɛ n'i ǎ, có yě ka byɔ́ Pilátu ɖɔ ní ná gbe nú è hu i. "
"When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb. ","Ée yě wa nǔ e Mawuxó ɔ́ ɖɔ dó wútu tɔn lɛ́ɛ bǐ xá ɛ vɔ ɔ́, yě wá ɖe cyɔ tɔn sín aklúzu jí, bó sɔ́ ɛ yi ɖi. "
"But God raised him from the dead, ","Lo ɔ́, Mawu ka fɔ́n ɛ sín kú, "
and for many days he was seen by those who had traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to our people. ,"bɔ é wá ɖe éɖée xlɛ́ mɛ e xwedó e sín Galilée wá Jeluzalɛ́mu lɛ́ɛ xɔ azǎn mɔ̌kpán. Mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ wɛ wá ɖo kúnnu ɖe n'i wɛ din ɖo Izlayɛ́li togun ɔ́ mɛ, "
“We tell you the good news: What God promised our fathers ,"bɔ mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mǐ wá ɖo Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ dó mi wɛ ɖɔ jí: akpá e Mawu ko dó nú tɔ́gbó mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, "
"he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm: “ ‘You are my Son; today I have become your Father. ’ ","é ɖe akpá énɛ́ ɔ́ nú mǐ vǐ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ hwenu e é fɔ́n Jezu sín kú lě e è ko wlán gbɔn ɖo Ɖɛhanwéma ɔ́ mɛ, ɖo ta tɔn wegɔ́ ɔ́ mɛ gbɔn ɔ́ ɖɔ jí: ‘Hwi wɛ nyí Vǐ ce; bɛ́ sín égbé ɔ́, un nyí Tɔ́ towe.’ "
"The fact that God raised him from the dead, never to decay, is stated in these words: “ ‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.’ ","Mawu ko ɖɔ ɖ'ayǐ ɖɔ émí ná fɔ́n ɛ sín kú, bónú é ma nyɔ ó.

So it is stated elsewhere: “ ‘You will not let your Holy One see decay.’ ,Énɛ́ wú wɛ é lɛ́ ɖɔ ɖo akpá ɖěvo xwé ɖɔ jí: ‘A nǎ lɔn nú mɛ mímɛ́ towe ná nyɔ ǎ.’ 
"“For when David had served God's purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep; he was buried with his fathers and his body decayed. ","Đó hwenu e Davídi nɔ gbɛ, bó bló jlǒ Mawu tɔn gúdo ɔ́, é wá kú, bɔ è ɖi i dó tɔ́gbó tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpá, bɔ cyɔ tɔn nyɔ ɖo yɔdo mɛ. "
But the one whom God raised from the dead did not see decay. ,"Lo ɔ́, mɛ e Mawu fɔ́n sín kú ɔ́, cyɔ éyɛ́ tɔn nyɔ ɖě ǎ. "
"“Therefore, my brothers, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. ","Nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, hǔn mi ɖó ná tunwun ɖɔ Jezu jí wɛ è jlǎ Wɛn Ɖagbe hwɛsɔ́kɛmɛ tɔn ɔ́ mi gbɔn. "
Through him everyone who believes is justified from everything you could not be justified from by the law of Moses. ,"Đó mɛ ɖěbǔ ɖi nǔ ɔ́, mɛ ɔ́ nɔ́ gosín hwɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ sín acɛ mɛ gbɔn jǐ tɔn; hwɛ sín acɛ mɛ e Mɔyízi sɛ́n ɔ́ ma sixú ɖe mi sín ǎ é; "
Take care that what the prophets have said does not happen to you: ,nú nǔ e gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ ko ɖɔ ɔ́ má wá jɛ dó mi jí ó
"“ ‘Look, you scoffers, wonder and perish, for I am going to do something in your days that you would never believe, even if someone told you.’ ” ","‘Mi kpɔ́n, mi wǎngbɛ́númɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ; ado ní hu mi, mi ní dɔn; ɖó hwe mitɔn nu ɔ́, un ná dó nǔɖé sin, bónú ɖɔ wɛ è wá ɖɔ nú mi ɔ́, mi ná ɖi ǎ.’ ” "
"As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people invited them to speak further about these things on the next Sabbath. ","Ée Pɔ́lu kpódó Baanabási kpán tɔ́n sín kplɔ́ngbasá ɔ́, mɛ lɛ́ɛ sa vo nú yě ɖɔ gbɔjɛzán gbe ée ná bɔ d'é wú ɔ́, yě ní wá ɖɔ xó dó nǔ ɖokpó ɔ́ wú. "
"When the congregation was dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with them and urged them to continue in the grace of God. ","Ée yě bló kplé ɔ́ fó ɔ́, Jwifu gěgé, kpódó yě mɛ e byɔ́ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ sín sinsɛn mɛ lɛ́ɛ gěgé kpán xwedó Pɔ́lu kpódó Baanabási kpó.

On the next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord. ,"Gbɔjɛzán gbe e jɛ fínɛ́ ɔ́, toxo ɔ́ mɛ nu lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɖibla kplé bó ná se Mawuxó. "
"When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and talked abusively against what Paul was saying. ","Ée Jwifu lɛ́ɛ mɔ lě e mɛ lɛ́ɛ sukpɔ́ sɔ ɔ́, wǔhwinhwan gɔ́ ayi yětɔn mɛ, bɔ yě nɔ́ mɔ xó vo ɖɔ dó Pɔ́lu sín xó wú, bó nɔ zun i. "
"Then Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly: “We had to speak the word of God to you first. Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles. ","Pɔ́lu kpódó Baanabási kpó ka ɖɔ xó kpódó jiɖiɖe kpó ɖɔ: “Midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ è ɖǒ ná ɖɔ Mawuxó ná hwɛ̌; ée mi ka gbɛ́, bó mɔ ɖɔ émí kún jɛ xá gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ ɔ́ ó ɔ́, din ɔ́, mǐ ná gbɔ bó yi mɛ e má nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ gɔ́n. "
"For this is what the Lord has commanded us: “ ‘I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.’ ” ","Đó lě e Aklúnɔ zɔ́n mǐ gbɔn é ɖíe: ‘Un sɔ́ we nú a nǎ nyí wěziza nú akɔta ɖě lɛ́ɛ, nú a nǎ jlá Wɛn Ɖagbe hwlɛngán tɔn ɔ́ káká yi fí e gbɛ ɔ́ kponu ɖó é.’ ” "
"When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed. ","Ée mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ se mɔ̌ ɔ́, xomɛ hun yě, bɔ yě jɛ susu kpa nú Aklúnɔxó ɔ́ jí; mɛ e è ko sɔ́ ɖ'ayǐ nú gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɖi nǔ nú Jezu. "
The word of the Lord spread through the whole region. ,Aklúnɔxó ɔ́ nɔ ɖo gbigba kpé wɛ gbɔn gbě ɔ́ bǐ jǐ. 
"But the Jews incited the God-fearing women of high standing and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region. ","Lo ɔ́, Jwifu lɛ́ɛ kplɔ́n nǔ nyɔ̌nu nukúnɖéjí e nɔ ɖó sísí nú Mawu lɛ́ɛ kpódó mɛjɔmɛ to ɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó, bɔ yě fɔ́n gǔ dó Pɔ́lu kpódó Baanabási kpó jí, bó nya yě sín to yětɔn mɛ. "
So they shook the dust from their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium. ,"Pɔ́lu kpódó Baanabási kpó ka xúxú afɔkɔ́ yětɔn kɔn nyi ayǐ nú yě, bó yi to e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Ikoniyɔ́mu é mɛ. "
And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.At Iconium Paul and Barnabas went as usual into the Jewish synagogue. There they spoke so effectively that a great number of Jews and Gentiles believed. ,"Awǎjijɛ kpódó Yɛsinsɛn kpó ká gɔ́ ayi mɛ nú ahwanvú Jezu tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖo Antyɔ́ci.Ée Pɔ́lu kpódó Baanabási kpó jɛ to e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Ikoniyɔ́mu ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, yě yi kplɔ́ngbasá Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn, bó ɖɔ xó nú yě, káká bɔ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ gěgé kpódó Glɛ̌sinu gěgé kpán ɖi nǔ nú Jezu. "
But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers. ,"Lo ɔ́, Jwifu e gbɛ́ nǔ ɖi lɛ́ɛ fɔ́n hun dó jǐ nú mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ, bó zɔ́n bɔ yě jɛ nǔ nyanya lin dó nɔví ɖo Klísu mɛ lɛ́ɛ wú jí. "
"So Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there, speaking boldly for the Lord, who confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to do miraculous signs and wonders. ","Pɔ́lu kpódó Baanabási kpán nɔ fínɛ́ ɖésú. Yě nɔ ɖɔ xó kpódó jiɖiɖe kpó.

"The people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, others with the apostles. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, to ɔ́ mɛ nu lɛ́ɛ sɔ́ ɖó gbe kpɔ́ ǎ; mɛ hǎbǔ ɖo Jwifu lɛ́ɛ jí, bɔ hǎbǔ ká ɖo mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ jí. "
"There was a plot afoot among the Gentiles and Jews, together with their leaders, to mistreat them and stone them. ","Mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ kpódó Jwifu lɛ́ɛ kpán sɔgbe dó gǎn yětɔn lɛ́ɛ wú, bó ɖo nǔ sɔ́ wɛ, bó ná dó ya nú mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ, lobo ná hu yě ɖó awǐnnyaglo wú. "
"But they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding country, ","Ée Pɔ́lu kpódó Baanabási kpó se mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě hɔn yi Lisitli kpó Dɛɛbe kpó, ɖo Likawoníi gbé jí kpódó to e yá fínɛ́ lɛ́ɛ kpán mɛ, "
where they continued to preach the good news. ,bó jɛ Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ jlá jí gbɔn fí énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌. 
"In Lystra there sat a man crippled in his feet, who was lame from birth and had never walked. ","Nya ɖé ɖo to e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Lisitli ɔ́ mɛ, bó nɔ́ ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n, ɖó afɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kú; sín hwenu e è ji nya énɛ́ ɔ́ ɖokpóó wɛ afɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ ko kú, bɔ é ɖi zɔnlin kpɔ́n gbeɖé ǎ. "
"He listened to Paul as he was speaking. Paul looked directly at him, saw that he had faith to be healed ","É ɖo xó e ɖɔ wɛ Pɔ́lu ɖe ɔ́ ɖótó wɛ. Pɔ́lu sín nukún wá yi jɛ jǐ tɔn, bɔ é kpɔ́n ɛ tlítlí, bó mɔ ɖɔ nya énɛ́ ɖó nǔɖiɖi e ná zɔ́n bɔ azɔn tɔn ná gbɔ é. "
"and called out, “Stand up on your feet!” At that, the man jumped up and began to walk. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, Pɔ́lu zé gbe yi jǐ, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Sí te bó jlɔ́ ɖo afɔ towe lɛ́ɛ jí.” Bɔ nya ɔ́ lɔ́n sí te, bó jɛ zɔnlin ɖi jí. "
"When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have come down to us in human form!” ","Ée mɛ e ɖo fínɛ́ lɛ́ɛ mɔ nǔ énɛ́ e Pɔ́lu jlɛ́ ɔ́, yě sú xó, bó ɖɔ dó Likawoníi gbe mɛ ɖɔ: “Nǔmɛsɛn lɛ́ɛ ɖíe húzú gbɛtɔ́ bó jɛ te wá mǐ mɛ e.” "
"Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker. ","Yě ylɔ́ Baanabási ɖɔ Zewúsi, bó ylɔ́ Pɔ́lu ɖɔ Ɛɛmɛsi; ɖó Pɔ́lu wɛ nyí ɖɛ̌mɛnu ɔ́. "
"The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them. ","Vodún Zewúsi e xɔ tɔn ɖo toxo ɔ́ nukɔn ɔ́ sín vodúnnɔ ka sɔ́ folówa bó dó ba acɔ́ nú nyibúsú ɖé lɛ́ɛ, bó dɔn yě wá hɔn lɛ́ɛ nu.

"But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting: ","Ée mɛsɛ́dó Baanabási kpódó Pɔ́lu kpán se mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě tlɛ́n awu dó kɔ nú yěɖée, bó dó wezun byɔ́ ahwan ɔ́ mɛ, bó ɖɔ: "
"“Men, why are you doing this? We too are only men, human like you.

","“Mɛ ce lɛ́ɛ mi, étɛ́wú mi ka ɖo mɔ̌ wa wɛ?

"In the past, he let all nations go their own way. ","Xóxó hwenu ɔ́, Mawu jó akɔta lɛ́ɛ bǐ dó, bɔ mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó nɔ sɔ́ ali e jló e é. "
Yet he has not left himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons,Fon
"Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them. ","Baanabási kpódó Pɔ́lu kpó ɖɔ mɔ̌ có, é fá cóbónú mɛ lɛ́ɛ wá yí gbe nú xó e yě ɖɔ ɔ́, bó jó vɔ̌ e sá nú yě gbé wɛ yě ja ɔ́ dó ǎ. "
"Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.

"But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city. The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe. ","Lo ɔ́, ée ahwanvú lɛ́ɛ lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó e ɔ́, é sí te bo lɛ́ byɔ́ toxo ɔ́ mɛ. Ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn ɔ́, é kpódó Baanabási kpán ɖidó to e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Dɛɛbe ɔ́ mɛ. "
"They preached the good news in that city and won a large number of disciples. Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium and Antioch, ","Baanabási kpódó Pɔ́lu kpó jlá Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ ɖo Dɛɛbe, bɔ mɛ gěgé ɖi nǔ nú Jezu. Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, yě lɛ́ kɔ yi Lisitli, Ikoniyɔ́mu kpódó Antyɔ́ci Pisidíi tɔn kpán. "

"Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church and, with prayer and fasting, committed them to the Lord, in whom they had put their trust. ","Pɔ́lu kpó Baanabási kpó sɔ́ agunnukɔntɔ́ ɖó yě nu, gbɔn agun ɖokpó ɖokpó mɛ. Yě blá nu, bó xo ɖɛ lobo sɔ́ yě dó alɔ mɛ nú Aklúnɔ e yě ɖi nǔ na é. "
"After going through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia, ",Mɛsɛ́dó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ka gbɔn Pisidíi wá Panfilíi. 
"and when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia. ","Yě wá ɖɔ Mawuxó ɖo Pɛɛjée; énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, yě wǎ Atalya. "
"From Attalia they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work they had now completed. ","Yě dó tɔjíhún ɖo fínɛ́, bó yi Antyɔ́ci; fínɛ́ wɛ è ko sɔ́ yě dó alɔ mɛ nú wǔjɔmɛ Mawu tɔn ɖe, nú azɔ̌ e yě wa din é. "
"On arriving there, they gathered the church together and reported all that God had done through them and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.

"And they stayed there a long time with the disciples.Some men came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the brothers: “Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved.” ","Yě nɔ fínɛ́ xá mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ xɔ azǎn gěgé.Mɛ ɖé lɛ́ɛ gosín Judée gbé jí, bó wá Antyɔ́ci, bó nɔ ɖo nǔ kplɔ́n nɔví ɖo Klísu mɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ ɖɔ: “Ényí è ma gbo ada nú mi lě e Mɔyízi sɛ́n ɔ́ zɔ́n gbɔn é ǎ ɔ́, Mawu ná hwlɛ́n mi gán ǎ.” "
"This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question.

"The church sent them on their way, and as they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told how the Gentiles had been converted. This news made all the brothers very glad.

"When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders, to whom they reported everything God had done through them.

The apostles and elders met to consider this question. ,"Mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ kpódó agunnukɔntɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpán kplé, bó ná gbéjé xó énɛ́ kpɔ́n. "
"After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: “Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe.

"God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us. ","Mawu e nɔ mɔ nǔ jɛ mɛ xomɛ ɔ́ ná yě Yɛsinsɛn lě e é ná mǐ gbɔn é, bó dó ɖe xlɛ́ ɖɔ émí yí yě. "

"No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.” ","Lo ɔ́, mǐ ɖi nǔ ɖɔ Mawu hwlɛ́n mǐ gán gbɔn xomɛ e Aklúnɔ Jezu nyɔ́ dó mǐ wú é gbla mɛ, lě e é hwlɛ́n yě lɔmɔ̌ gán gbɔn é.” "
The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the miraculous signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, agun ɔ́ bǐ nɔ abwɛ̌ tóó, bó ɖótó Baanabási kpódó Pɔ́lu kpán, bɔ yě wlǐ nǔ e Mawu jlɛ́ ɔ́, kpódó nǔdábaɖa e é ɖe xlɛ́ gbɔn yě jí, ɖo mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ tɛ́ntin é bǐ ɖɔ.

"When they finished, James spoke up: “Brothers, listen to me. ","Ée Pɔ́lu kpódó Baanabási kpó ɖɔ xó vɔ ɔ́, Jaki yí xó, bó ɖɔ: “Nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ e mi, mi ɖótó mì. "
Simon has described to us how God at first showed his concern by taking from the Gentiles a people for himself. ,"Sinmɔ́ɔ ɖɔ lě e Mawu kpé nukún dó mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ wú gbɔn, bó sɔ́ togun ɖokpó ɖo yě mɛ, bɔ é nyí étɔn sín do é; "

"“It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God. ","Jaki lɛ́ ɖɔ: “Nǔ é wútu nyɛ mɔ ɖɔ é kún nyɔ́ nú è nǎ dó tagba nú yě mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ, bó ka wá Mawu gɔ́n lɛ́ɛ ó é nɛ́. "
"Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood.

For Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.” ,"Đó, xóxó hwenu ɖokpóó wɛ mɛ lɛ́ɛ nɔ ɖo Mɔyízisɛ́n ɔ́ jlá wɛ gbɔn to ɖokpó ɖokpó mɛ, bɔ è nɔ xa ɖo kplɔ́ngbasá Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn, ɖo gbɔjɛzán gbe lɛ́ɛ bǐ.” "
"Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, two men who were leaders among the brothers. ","Énɛ́ gúdo ɔ́, mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ kpódó agunnukɔntɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpán, kpódó agun nǔɖitɔ́ lɛ́ɛ tɔn ɔ́ bǐ sésé kpán ɖó gbe kpɔ́, bó ɖe mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖo yěɖée mɛ, bó sɛ́ yě dó Antyɔ́ci, yě kpó Pɔ́lu kpó, kpó Baanabási kpó; mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ wɛ nyí Judási e è sun nyǐ ɖɔ Baasabási é kpódó Silási kpán; gbɛtɔ́ nukúnɖéjí wɛ yě nyǐ, ɖo nɔví ɖo Klísu mɛ lɛ́ɛ mɛ.

"With them they sent the following letter: The apostles and elders, your brothers, To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia: Greetings.

"We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said. ","Mǐ se ɖɔ mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ gosín mǐ gɔ̌n, bó wá dɔn hunnyahunnya byɔ́ mi mɛ, gbɔn xó e yě ɖɔ nú mi lɛ́ɛ gbla mɛ, lobo gba ayi dó nú mi; mǐ ká zɔ́n nǔɖé yě ǎ. "
So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul– ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ mǐ bǐ ɖó gbe kpɔ́, bó ɖe mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖo mǐ mɛ, bó sɛ́ yě dó mi; yě xwedó nɔví mǐtɔn vívɛ́ná Baanabási kpódó Pɔ́lu kpán. "
men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. ,"Adǎn gěgé kó gbo Baanabási kpódó Pɔ́lu kpó, bɔ yě ko ɖibla kú dó Aklúnɔ mǐtɔn Jezu Klísu sín nyǐkɔ tamɛ. "
Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing. ,"Mǐ sɛ́ Judási kpódó Silási kpán dó, nú yě ɖésúnɔ ná wá ɖɔ nǔ e mǐ wlán sɛ́ dó mi din ɔ́ nú mi. "
It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements: ,Yɛsinsɛn kpódó mǐ kpó mɔ ɖɔ mǐ kún sɔ́ ná zɔ́n azɔ̌ ɖěvo mi zɛ ée ɖo tají bɔ mi ɖó ná wa é wú ó
"You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. Farewell.

"The men were sent off and went down to Antioch, where they gathered the church together and delivered the letter. ","È jǒ yě dó, bɔ yě ɖidó Antyɔ́ci. Ée yě jɛ dɔ̌n ɔ́, yě kplé nɔví ɖo Klísu mɛ e ɖo fínɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ, bó sɔ́ wěma ɔ́ jó nú yě. "
The people read it and were glad for its encouraging message. ,"Ée yě xa wěma ɔ́, xomɛ hun yě, ɖó xó e ɖo wěma ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ ná akɔ́nkpinkpan yě. "
"Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the brothers. ","Judási kpódó Silási kpán ɔ́, gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn wɛ yě lɔmɔ̌ nyǐ; yě ɖɔ xó gěgé nú nɔví ɖo Klísu mɛ lɛ́ɛ, bó dó ná akɔ́nkpinkpan kpódó lanmɛsyɛ́nsyɛ́n kpán yě. "
"After spending some time there, they were sent off by the brothers with the blessing of peace to return to those who had sent them. ","Yě nɔ fínɛ́ nú azǎn yɔywɛ ɖé, bɔ nɔví ɖo Klísu mɛ lɛ́ɛ nyi yě sɛ́ dó mɛ e sɛ́ yě dó lɛ́ɛ gɔ́n, bó ɖɔ yě na yi ɖagbe. [ "
"But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, where they and many others taught and preached the word of the Lord. ","Pɔ́lu kpódó Baanabási kpó ka cí Antyɔ́ci, bɔ yě kpódó mɛ gěgé ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ kpán nɔ ɖo nǔ kplɔ́n mɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ, bó nɔ́ ɖo Wɛn Ɖagbe Aklúnɔ tɔn jlá wɛ. "
"Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us go back and visit the brothers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing.” ","Ée azǎn ɖé jɛ ɔ́, Pɔ́lu wá ɖɔ nú Baanabási ɖɔ: “Mǐ ná lɛ́ kɔ yi kpɔ́n nɔví mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖo to e mɛ mǐ jlá Aklúnɔxó ɔ́ gbɔn lɛ́ɛ bǐ, bó ná kpɔ́n lě e yě ɖe gbɔn é.” "
"Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them, ",Baanabási ka jló ná kplá Jǎan e è sun nyǐ ɖɔ Maki ɔ́
"but Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work. ","Pɔ́lu ka mɔ ɖɔ è kún ná kplá ɛ ó, ɖó é ko jó yě dó ɖo Panfilíi ɖokpóó, bó sɔ́ nɔ́ xwedó yě yi azɔ̌ wa gbé ǎ. "
"They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus, ","Nǔ dindɔn ɔ́ syɛ́n káká, bɔ Pɔ́lu kpódó Baanabási kpó klán. Baanabási ka kplá Maki, bɔ yě dó tɔjíhún, bó ɖidó tɔtɛ́ntinto e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Cíplu ɔ́ gbé jí. "
"but Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord. ","Pɔ́lu kplá Silási bo ɖidó, bɔ nɔví ɖo Klísu mɛ lɛ́ɛ sɔ́ Pɔ́lu dó alɔ mɛ nú wǔjɔmɛ Aklúnɔ tɔn. "
"He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.He came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where a disciple named Timothy lived, whose mother was a Jewess and a believer, but whose father was a Greek. ","É gbɔn Silíi gbé jí, bó gbɔn Silisíi gbé jí, bó dó wǔsyɛ́n lanmɛ nú agun Klísu tɔn lɛ́ɛ.Pɔ́lu ka wá Dɛɛbe, bó gosín fínɛ́ wá Lisitli.

The brothers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him. ,Nɔví ɖo Klísu mɛ e ɖo Lisitli kpódó Ikoniyɔ́mu kpán lɛ́ɛ ka nɔ ɖe kúnnu ɖagbe nú Timɔtée
"Paul wanted to take him along on the journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. ","bɔ Pɔ́lu jló ɖɔ é ní xwedó émí, lobo kplá ɛ; é gbo ada n'i, ɖó Jwifu e ɖo gbě énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ jí lɛ́ɛ wú; ɖó mɛ bǐ tunwun ɖɔ Timɔtée sín tɔ́ ɔ́, Glɛ̌sinu wɛ. "
"As they traveled from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey. ","Đo to e Pɔ́lu kpódó Timɔtée kpán nɔ gbɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɔ́, yě nɔ́ ɖɔ gbeta e mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ kpódó agunnukɔntɔ́ Jeluzalɛ́mu tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpán ɖe tɔ́n ɔ́ nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ, bó nɔ́ byɔ́ yě ɖɔ yě ní se tónú nú gbeta énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ.

So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers. ,"Bɔ agun nǔɖitɔ́ lɛ́ɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ nɔ ɖo dǒ lí wɛ ɖo nǔɖiɖi mɛ, bó nɔ́ ɖo jijɛ jí wɛ ayǐhɔ́ngbe ayǐhɔ́ngbe. "
"Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia. ","Yɛsinsɛn ka lɔn nú Pɔ́lu kpódó Silási kpó ní jlá Mawuxó ɖo Azíi gbé jí ǎ, énɛ́ ɔ́, yě dín gbɔn Flijíi gbé jí, bó dín gbɔn Galati gbé jí. "
"When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to. ","Yě sɛ yá Mizíi gbé jí, bó tɛ́nkpɔ́n ná yi tokpɔn e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Bitiníi é mɛ; lo ɔ́, Yɛ Jezu tɔn lɔn nú yě ǎ, "
So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas. ,"bɔ yě dín gbɔn Mizíi, bó yi to e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Tlowasi é mɛ. "
"During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.” ","Zǎn mɛ ɔ́, Mawu ɖe nǔɖé xlɛ́ Pɔ́lu: é mɔ Masedwaninu ɖokpó ɖo te, bó ɖo vo sa n'i wɛ ɖɔ: “Kɛnklɛ́n wǎ Masedwani, bó wá dó alɔ mǐ.” "
"After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them. ","Ée Pɔ́lu mɔ nǔ énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, mǐ sɔ́ nǔ, azɔn ɖokpó, bó ná yi Masedwani, ɖó mǐ mɔ gaan ɖɔ Mawu wɛ ylɔ́ mǐ, nú mǐ ná yi jlá Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ to énɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ nu lɛ́ɛ. "
"From Troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace, and the next day on to Neapolis. ","Mǐ dǒ tɔjíhún ɖo Tlowasi, bó zɔn mɔ̌ tlɔlɔ yi tɔtɛ́ntinto e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Samɔtlási ɔ́ mɛ, bɔ ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn ɔ́, mǐ yi Nɛyapolísi. "
"From there we traveled to Philippi, a Roman colony and the leading city of that district of Macedonia. And we stayed there several days. ","Mǐ gosín fínɛ́, bó yi toxo ɖaxó e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Filípu ɔ́ mɛ; toxo énɛ́ ɖo tokpɔnla nukɔntɔn Masedwani tɔn mɛ, ɖo Hlɔ̌manu lɛ́ɛ sín acɛ mɛ. Mǐ nɔ to énɛ́ mɛ xɔ azǎn nabí ɖé. "
"On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there. ","Gbɔjɛzán gbe Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn ɔ́, mǐ tɔ́n sín toxo ɔ́ mɛ, bó yi tɔ tó, bó vɛdó ɖɔ mǐ ná mɔ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ sín ɖɛxotɛn ɖé ɖo fínɛ́ wɛ sín. Mǐ jínjɔ́n ayǐ, bó ɖɔ xó xá nyɔ̌nu e kplé ɖo fínɛ́ lɛ́ɛ. "
"One of those listening was a woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul's message. ","Nyɔ̌nu énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖě nɔ nyí Lidíi, bó gosín Tiatíi, bó nɔ́ sa akwɛ́núvɔ vɔvɔ ɖé lɛ́ɛ; é nɔ sí Mawu; é ɖo tó ɖó mǐ wɛ, bɔ Aklúnɔ hun ayi tɔn, bɔ é wlí tó xó e ɖɔ wɛ Pɔ́lu ɖe ɔ́ wú. "
"When she and the members of her household were baptized, she invited us to her home. “If you consider me a believer in the Lord,” she said, “come and stay at my house.” And she persuaded us. ","É kpódó mɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó lɛ yɛhwesin; énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, é sa vo nú mǐ ɖɔ: “Ényí mi mɔ ɖɔ un ɖi nǔ nú Aklúnɔ nǔgbó hǔn, mi wá nɔ xwé ce gbe.” É zín mǐ jǐ bɔ mǐ gbɔ bó yí gbe, bó yi nɔ xwé tɔn gbe. "
"Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling. ","Mǐ wá xwe ɖɛxotɛnmɛ gbe ɖokpó, bó kpé nyɔ̌nu mɛsɛntɔ́ ɖé, bɔ yɛ nyanya ɖé ɖo jǐ tɔn, bɔ é nɔ kan amɔɛ nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ. Nǔ énɛ́ e é nɔ wa ɔ́ nɔ zɔ́n, bɔ é nɔ dɔn akwɛ́ gěgé wá nú gǎn tɔn lɛ́ɛ. "
"This girl followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved.” ","Nyɔ̌nu énɛ́ ɔ́ jɛ Pɔ́lu kpó mǐ kpó gúdo, bó nɔ sú xó ɖɔ: “Mɛ élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, Mawu Ajalɔ̌nlɔn sín mɛsɛntɔ́ wɛ nú yě; hwlɛngán sín ali ɔ́ sín xó ɖɔ nú mi wɛ yě ɖe.” "
"She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so troubled that he turned around and said to the spirit, “In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!” At that moment the spirit left her. ","Mɔ̌ wɛ é ɖo mǐ gúdo xɔ azǎn mɔ̌kpán, bɔ é wá vɛ́ Pɔ́lu wú gbe ɖokpó, bɔ é lɛ́ kɔ bó ɖɔ nú yɛ e ɖo nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ jí ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Đo Jezu Klísu nyǐkɔ mɛ ɔ́, un ɖe gbe dó we: gosín nyɔ̌nu élɔ́ jí;” bɔ yɛ ɔ́ gosín nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ jí tlóló tɛn tɔn mɛ.

"When the owners of the slave girl realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities. ","Ée nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ sín gǎn lɛ́ɛ mɔ ɖɔ é kún sɔ́ ɖo akwɛ́ ɖé ná dɔn wá nú émí wɛ ó ɔ́, yě wlǐ Pɔ́lu kpódó Silási kpán, bó dɔn yě yi tokplétɛn ɖo gǎn lɛ́ɛ nukɔn; "

"After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully. ","Ée yě xo yě, bɔ bǎkpa kpé yě wú ɔ́, yě kplá yě dó gankpá mɛ, bó ɖɔ nú gǎn e kpa acɛ dó gankpá ɔ́ nu ɔ́ ɖɔ ní cɔ́ yě ganjí. "
"Upon receiving such orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks. ","Ée gǎn ɔ́ se mɔ̌ ɔ́, é kplá yě yi sú dó xɔ ɖé mɛ, ɖo gankpá ɔ́ tɛ́ntin, bó ján afɔ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ dó sókpo mɛ, lobo sú hɔn dó yě. "

"Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everybody's chains came loose.

Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house. ,Bɔ yě ɖɔ Aklúnɔxó nú é kpódó mɛ e ɖo xwé tɔn gbe lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpán. 
At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds,Fon
The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them,Fon
"When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order: “Release those men.” ","Ayǐ ka wá hɔ́n, bɔ hwɛɖɔtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ sɛ́ sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ dó, nú yě ní yi ɖɔ nú gǎn e kpa acɛ dó gankpá ɔ́ nu ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Jǒ Pɔ́lu kpódó Silási kpó dó;” "

"But Paul said to the officers: “They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to get rid of us quietly? No!

"After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia's house, where they met with the brothers and encouraged them. Then they left.When they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue. ","Đěe Pɔ́lu kpódó Silási kpán tɔ́n sín gankpá ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, yě wǎ yi Lidíi xwé, bó mɔ nɔví ɖo Klísu mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖo fínɛ́, bó dó wǔsyɛ́n lanmɛ nú yě, lobo ɖidó.Pɔ́lu kpódó Silási kpó gbɔn Anfipolísi kpódó Apoloni kpó mɛ dín, bó wá Tɛsaloniki; kplɔ́ngbasá ɖokpó ka ɖo fínɛ́.

"As his custom was, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, ","Pɔ́lu yi kplɔ́ngbasá ɔ́ lě e é ko nɔ bló gbɔn é. Gbɔjɛzán gbe atɔn ɖě jɛ ɖě gúdo ɔ́, é dɔn nǔ xá mɛ e ɖo kplɔ́ngbasá ɔ́ lɛ́ɛ dó nǔ e è wlǎn dó Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ wú. "
"explaining and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead. “This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Christ, ” he said. ","É tín nǔ e è wlán dó wěma ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ mɛ nú yě, bó ɖe xlɛ́ yě ɖɔ Klísu ɖó ná ji ya káká bó kú, bɔ Mawu ka ná fɔ́n ɛ sín kú lě e è wlǎn dó Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ gbɔn é; é ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Klísu énɛ́ wɛ nyí Jezu e xó ɖɔ nú mi wɛ un ɖe é.” "
"Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and not a few prominent women. ","Mɛ ɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖo mɛ e ɖo tó ɖó yě wɛ lɛ́ɛ mɛ, bɔ xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ byɔ́ ayi mɛ nú yě, bɔ yě gɔ́ nú Pɔ́lu kpódó Silási kpán; mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, Glɛ̌sinu e nɔ ɖó sísí nú Mawu lɛ́ɛ gěgé kpódó nyɔ̌nu nukúnɖéjí gěgé kpán gɔ́ nú yě. "
"But the Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd. ","Lo ɔ́, Jwifu lɛ́ɛ jɛ wǔ hwan jí, bó cyán toví dídá nǔvɔ́nɔ e nɔ́ ɖo dǐndán gbɔn alixo alixo wɛ lɛ́ɛ kplé; yě dɔn hunnyahunnya dó ahwan ɔ́ mɛ, bó dɔn to ɔ́ bǐ wlú.

"But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials, shouting: “These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here, ","Ée yě ma mɔ yě ǎ ɔ́, yě zɔn Jazɔ́ɔn kpódó nɔví ɖo Klísu mɛ ɖé lɛ́ɛ kpán jí, bó dɔn yě yi gǎn e ɖo to ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ nukɔn, bó sú xó ɖɔ: “Mɛ e dɔn to fúnlɛ̌n gbɔn gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ wá ayǐkúngban mǐtɔn jí, "
"and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar's decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.” ","bɔ Jazɔ́ɔn ka yí yě dó xwé tɔn gbe; yě mɛ bǐ wɛ nɔ gba sɛ́n e Dadá Hlɔ̌ma tɔn dó lɛ́ɛ, bó nɔ ɖɔ axɔ́sú ɖěvo tíin bó nɔ́ nyí Jezu.” "

Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go. ,"bɔ Jazɔ́ɔn kpódó mɛ e è wlǐ gɔ́ n'i lɛ́ɛ kpán tó sɔ́ akwɛ́ ɖé ɖó gbanu hwɛ̌, cóbɔ è jó yě dó bɔ yě tɔ́n. "
"As soon as it was night, the brothers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue. ","Ée nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ jɛ tlóló ɔ́, nɔví ɖo Klísu mɛ lɛ́ɛ nyi Pɔ́lu kpódó Silási kpán sɛ́ dó Belée gbe nɛ́ gbe zǎn mɛ. Ée yě jɛ dɔ̌n ɔ́, yě yi kplɔ́ngbasá Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn. "
"Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true. ","Jwifu e ɖo fínɛ́ lɛ́ɛ nyɔ́ xomɛ hú éé ɖo Tɛsaloniki lɛ́ɛ; yě yí Mawuxó se kpódó jlǒ ɖagbe kpán.

"Many of the Jews believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men. ","Bɔ mɛ gěgé ɖo yě mɛ, bó ɖi nǔ nú Jezu; mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, nyɔ̌nu Glɛ̌sinu nukúnɖéjí gěgé kpódó súnnu gěgé kpán ɖi nǔ nú Jezu. "
"When the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, they went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up. ","Lo ɔ́, éé Jwifu e ɖo Tɛsaloniki lɛ́ɛ se ɖɔ Pɔ́lu ɖo Mawuxó jlá wɛ ɖo Belée lɔmɔ̌ ɔ́, yě wá kplɔ́n nǔ mɛ lɛ́ɛ, bɔ yě fɔ́n gǔ, bó jɛ hunnyahunnya dó to ɔ́ mɛ jí, "
"The brothers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea. ",bɔ nɔví ɖo Klísu mɛ lɛ́ɛ yá wǔ nyi Pɔ́lu sɛ́ dó xuwa jí
The men who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible. ,Yě mɛ e ɖo Pɔ́lu nyi wɛ lɛ́ɛ kplá ɛ káká yi jɛ to e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Atɛ́ni é mɛ bó lɛ́ kɔ.

"While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols. ","Hwenu e Pɔ́lu ɖo te kpɔ́n Silási kpódó Timɔtée kpó ɖo Atɛ́ni ɔ́, é mɔ lě e vodún sukpɔ́ gbɔn ɖo to ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, bɔ é sin xomɛ n'i tlala. "
"So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there. ","É nɔ yi kplɔ́ngbasá, bó nɔ́ ɖo nǔ dɔn xá Jwifu lɛ́ɛ kpódó mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ, bó ka nɔ́ sɛn Mawu lɛ́ɛ kpán wɛ.

"A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to dispute with him. Some of them asked, “What is this babbler trying to say?” Others remarked, “He seems to be advocating foreign gods.” They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection. ","Glɛ̌sinu nǔnywɛ́tɔ́ e è nɔ ylɔ́ Epikiliɛn lɛ́ɛ kpódó ée è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Sitoyisiɛn lɛ́ɛ kpán lɔ jɛ xó ɖɔ xá ɛ jí.

"Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? ","Bɔ yě kplá Pɔ́lu yi mɛ e nɔ́ kplé ɖo fí e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Aleopaji lɛ́ɛ nukɔn, bó kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Nǔkplɔ́nmɛ yɔ̌yɔ́ e a hɛn wá ɔ́, a sixú tínmɛ nú mǐ a? "
"You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we want to know what they mean.” ","Đó nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ a ɖe ɔ́ nɔ́ búdo dó mǐ, bɔ mǐ jló ná mɔ nǔ jɛ mɛ.” "
(All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.) ,"(Lo ɔ́, Atɛ́ninu lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpódó jǒnɔ e ɖo yě mɛ lɛ́ɛ kpán ɔ́, yě sɔ́ nɔ́ sɔ́ hwenu yětɔn dó wa nǔɖé ná zɛ yě ná ɖɔ xó yɔ̌yɔ́ e tíin lɛ́ɛ, abǐ yě ná ɖótó xó yɔ̌yɔ́ e tíin lɛ́ɛ wú ǎ.) "
Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: “Men of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. ,"Pɔ́lu ka sí te ɖo mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ e nɔ kplé ɖo Aleopaji lɛ́ɛ tɛ́ntin, bó ɖɔ: “Atɛ́ninu lɛ́ɛ mi; un mɔ ɖɔ mi nyí sinsɛnnɔ tawun. "
"For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you. ","Đó hwenu e un ɖo to mitɔn mɛ gbɔn wɛ ɔ́, un mɔ vodúnxɔ gěgé sín vɔ̌sákpe; un tlɛ wá yi mɔ vɔ̌sákpe ɖé, bɔ è wlǎn d'é jí ɖɔ: ‘Vodún e è ma tunwun ǎ é tɔn ɖíe.’ Nǔ e mi ma tunwun ǎ bó ka nɔ́ sɛn ɔ́ sín xó ɖɔ nú mi gbé wɛ un ja. "
“The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands. ,"Mawu e bló gbɛ ɔ́ kpódó nǔ e ɖ'é mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpán ɔ́, é wɛ nyí Aklúnɔ jǐxwé kpódó ayǐkúngban kpán tɔn. Mawu énɛ́ ka nɔ́ nɔ sinsɛnxɔ e gbɛtɔ́ bló ɔ́ mɛ ǎ. "
"And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else. ","É ka ba nú gbɛtɔ́ ní bló nǔ alɔkpa ɖěbǔ dó sɛn ɛ ná nǔɖé wɛ hudó e ɖɔhun ǎ; é wɛ nɔ́ ná gbɛ, bó nɔ́ ná funfún kpódó nǔ bǐ kpó gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ. "
"From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live. ","Gbɛtɔ́ ɖokpó géé jí wɛ é ɖó togun lɛ́ɛ bǐ gbɔn, bó ma yě kpé ayǐkúngban ɔ́ bǐ sésé jí; é ɖó hwenu lɛ́ɛ, bó ka ɖó dogbó nú nɔtɛn togun lɛ́ɛ tɔn ɖokpó ɖokpó. "
"God did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us. ","Mawu to nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ gbɔn mɔ̌, bónú gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ná dó ba ɛ, bónú yě ɖo biba ɛ wɛ káká ɔ́, afɔ nyɔ́ ɔ́, yě sixú wá yi mɔ ɛ; có Mawu ka sɔ́ lín dó ɖokpó ɖokpó mǐtɔn ǎ. "
"‘For in him we live and move and have our being.’ As some of your own poets have said, ‘We are his offspring.’ ","“Đó, é wɛ zɔ́n bɔ mǐ ɖo gbɛ; é wɛ zɔ́n bɔ mǐ ɖo wǔ dǎn wɛ; é wɛ zɔ́n bɔ mǐ tíin. Nǔnywɛ́tɔ́ mitɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖésú ko ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɖɔ jí: “Vǐ tɔn wɛ mǐ nyí.” "
"“Therefore since we are God's offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone–an image made by man's design and skill. ","“Ée é ka nyí ɖɔ Mawu sín vǐ wɛ mǐ nyí é ɔ́, mǐ sɔ́ ɖó ná lin ɖɔ Mawu cí siká abǐ kpatágan abǐ awǐnnya ɖagbe ɖagbe e gbɛtɔ́ sɔ́ linlin tɔn kpódó aɖawun tɔn kpó dó kɔn ná é ɖɔhun ǎ. "
"In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent. ","Nǔ ma nywɛ́ sín gbɛ e gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kó zán ɖo hwenu e yě ɖo manywɛ́ mɛ ɔ́, Mawu lɛ́n hwɛ tɔn dó kɔ nú yě ǎ; amɔ̌ din ɔ́, é wá ɖo byɔ̌byɔ́ gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ, ɖo fí ɖěbǔ e yě kó ɖe ɔ́, ɖɔ yě ní lɛ́ kɔ sín hwɛ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ gúdo. "
For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead.” ,"Đó é sɔ́ azǎn ɖokpó ɖó te, bɔ azǎn énɛ́ gbe ɔ́, é ná xwedó hwɛjijɔ, bó ɖɔ hwɛ xá gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ, gbɔn mɛ e é ɖésúnɔ ko ɖe ɖó vo ɔ́ jí.

"When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, “We want to hear you again on this subject.” ","Ée mɛ lɛ́ɛ se fínfɔ́n sín kú xó ɔ́, mɛ ɖě ko e; mɛ ɖě ka ɖɔ: “Mǐ ná se xó towe dó nǔ énɛ́ wú azǎn ɖěvo gbe.” "
"At that, Paul left the Council. ",Pɔ́lu ka gosín yě mɛ. 
"A few men became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others.After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. ","É ɖo mɔ̌ có, mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ xwedó e, bó ɖi nǔ: mɛ e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Denisi ɖo mɛ e nɔ kplé ɖo Aleopaji lɛ́ɛ mɛ é, kpó nyɔ̌nu e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Damalísi ɔ́ kpó, kpódó mɛ ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ kpán ɖo yě mɛ.Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, Pɔ́lu gosín Atɛ́ni, bó yi Kɔlɛ́nti.

"There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them, ","É mɔ nya Jwifu ɖokpó ɖo fínɛ́; è nɔ ylɔ́ nya ɔ́ ɖɔ Akilási, bɔ é nyí tokpɔn Pɔ́ɔn mɛ nu; nya énɛ́ kpódó asi tɔn Plisílu kpó gosín Italíi wá ɔ́, é ko lín ǎ, ɖó axɔ́sú Klódu ɖe gbeta tɔ́n ɖɔ mɛ e nyí Jwifu lɛ́ɛ bǐ ní tɔ́n sín Hlɔ̌ma; Pɔ́lu yi mɔ yě.

"and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them. ","Ée Pɔ́lu kpódó yě kpó ɔ́, azɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́ wɛ yě nɔ́ wa ɔ́, Pɔ́lu nɔ xwé yětɔn gbe, bɔ yě nɔ́ wa azɔ̌ ɖó kpɔ́ yě nɔ́ gbá goxɔ. "
"Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks. ","Gbɔjɛzán gbe Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn tɛgbɛ ɔ́, Pɔ́lu nɔ yi ɖɔ xó ɖo kplɔ́ngbasá, bó nɔ́ tɛ́nkpɔ́n bɔ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ kpódó Glɛ̌sinu lɛ́ɛ kpán nɔ mɔ nǔgbó nú xó tɔn. "
"When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ. ","Ée Silási kpódó Timɔtée kpó gosín Masedwani wá ɔ́, Pɔ́lu jó éɖée nú Mawuxó ɖiɖɔ kɛ́ɖɛ́, bó nɔ́ ɖe kúnnu nú Jezu ɖo Jwifu lɛ́ɛ nukɔn ɖɔ Jezu wɛ nyí Klísu; "
"But when the Jews opposed Paul and became abusive, he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am clear of my responsibility. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.” ","lo ɔ́, Jwifu lɛ́ɛ jló ná se xó tɔn ǎ, bó nɔ́ ɖo zunzun i wɛ; é ka xúxú awu tɔn lɛ́ɛ, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Ényí nǔɖé ɔ́, ní nyí nú mi; nyɛ ko ɖe nyɛtɔn sín mɛ. Bɛ́ sín din ɔ́, un ná nɔ́ yi mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ gɔ́n.” "
"Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus, a worshiper of God. ","Pɔ́lu ka gosín fínɛ́ bó yi nya ɖé gɔ́n; nya ɔ́ nɔ nyí Titiwusi-Jusitúsi. Nya énɛ́ ɖó sísí nú Mawu, bɔ xwé tɔn ɖo kplɔ́ngbasá Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn kpá. "
"Crispus, the synagogue ruler, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard him believed and were baptized. ","Klisipúsi e nyí kplɔ́ngbasá Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn sín gǎn ɔ́ kpódó xwédo tɔn bǐ kpán ɖi nǔ nú Aklúnɔ. Kɔlɛ́ntinu e ɖótó Pɔ́lu lɛ́ɛ gěgé ɖi nǔ nú Jezu, bó lɛ yɛhwesin. "
"One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: “Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent. ","Pɔ́lu ka mɔ nǔ zǎn mɛ gbe ɖokpó; é mɔ Aklúnɔ, bɔ é ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Ma ɖi xɛsi ó; lo ɔ́, ɖo xó ɖɔ wɛ; ma nɔ abwɛ̌ ó; "
"For I am with you, and no one is going to attack and harm you, because I have many people in this city.” ","ɖó un ɖo kpɔ́ xá we, bɔ mɛ ɖěbǔ ná ɖó alɔ wú we, bó wa nǔ nyanya xá we ǎ; ɖɔ xó, ɖó mɛ gěgé ɖo to élɔ́ mɛ, bó nyí ce.” "
"So Paul stayed for a year and a half, teaching them the word of God. ","Pɔ́lu nɔ Kɔlɛ́nti fínɛ́ xɔ xwe ɖokpó adaɖé, bó nɔ́ ɖo Mawuxó kplɔ́n mɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ. "
"While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack on Paul and brought him into court. ","Hwenu e Galiɔ́ɔn nyí tokpɔngán ɖo Akáyi gbé jí ɔ́, Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ɖó gbe kpɔ́, bó sí te dó Pɔ́lu jí; yě wlǐ i, bó kplá ɛ yi hwɛ nukɔn, "
"“This man,” they charged, “is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law.” ","bó ɖɔ: “Nya élɔ́ nɔ́ ɖɔ xó nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ, bó ná dó dɔn yě nú yě ná sɛn Mawu lě e sɛ́n ɔ́ ma zɔ́n gbɔn ǎ é.” "
"Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to the Jews, “If you Jews were making a complaint about some misdemeanor or serious crime, it would be reasonable for me to listen to you. ","Hwenu e Pɔ́lu jló ná kɛ nu dó xó énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, Galiɔ́ɔn ɖɔ nú Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Jwifu lɛ́ɛ mi; ényí nǔ nyanya ɖé wɛ é dó sin abǐ agɔ ɖé wɛ é jɛ din ɔ́, un ná kú hǔn, bó se xó mitɔn. "
But since it involves questions about words and names and your own law–settle the matter yourselves. I will not be a judge of such things.” ,"Lo ɔ́, ée ényí nǔ dɔn wɛ mi ɖe dó xógbe ɖé lɛ́ɛ wú, nyǐkɔ ɖé lɛ́ɛ wú, kpódó sɛ́n mi ɖésúnɔ tɔn kpán wú ɔ́, mi ɖésúnɔ wɛ ná kpɔ́n bó ɖɔ.

So he had them ejected from the court. ,"Ée é ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, é nya yě sín hwɛɖɔxɔ ɔ́ sá. "
Then they all turned on Sosthenes the synagogue ruler and beat him in front of the court. But Gallio showed no concern whatever. ,"Yě bǐ ka zɔn Sositɛ́nu e ɖo kplɔ́ngbasá Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn sín gǎn nyí wɛ hwenɛ́nu ɔ́ jí, bó jɛ xixo e jí ɖo hwɛɖɔxɔ ɔ́ nukɔn.

"Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before he sailed, he had his hair cut off at Cenchrea because of a vow he had taken. ","Pɔ́lu lɛ́ nɔ Kɔlɛ́nti xɔ azǎn gěgé; énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, é jó nɔví ɖo Klísu mɛ lɛ́ɛ dó, bó dó tɔjíhún ɖidó Silíi, bɔ Plisílu kpódó Akilási kpó xwedó e; cóbónú é ka ná ɖidó ɔ́, é xwlɛ́ ɖa ɖo to e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Sanklé ɔ́ mɛ, ɖó akpá e é kó dó nú Mawu é wú.

"They arrived at Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. ","Ée yě wá yi jɛ Efɛ́zi ɔ́, Pɔ́lu jó Plisílu kpódó Akilási kpán dó; é yi kplɔ́ngbasá, bó dɔn nǔ xá Jwifu lɛ́ɛ. "
"When they asked him to spend more time with them, he declined. ","Jwifu lɛ́ɛ dó kɛnklɛ́n n'i ɖɔ ní nɔ émí gɔ́n kpɛɖé d'é jí, bɔ é gbɛ́. "
"But as he left, he promised, “I will come back if it is God's will.” Then he set sail from Ephesus. ","Hwenu e é ja yě gɔ̌n gosín gbé ɔ́, é ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Ényí Mawu jló ɔ́, un ná lɛ́ wá mi gɔ́n hwe ɖěvo nu.” Ée é ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, é yi byɔ́ tɔjíhún mɛ ɖo Efɛ́zi, bó ɖidó. "
"When he landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church and then went down to Antioch. ","Ée é wá yi jɛ te ɖo Sezalée ɔ́, é yi dó gbe agun nǔɖitɔ́ lɛ́ɛ tɔn ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu, bó yi Antyɔ́ci. "
"After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out from there and traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.

"Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures. ","Nya Jwifu ɖé tíin, bɔ è ji i ɖo Alɛsándli; è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Apolosu; nya énɛ́ wá Efɛ́zi; é nyɔ́ xó ɖɔ, lobo tunwun Mawuxó ɔ́ ganjí. "
"He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great fervor and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John.

"He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately.

"When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On arriving, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed.

"For he vigorously refuted the Jews in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus.

"and asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” They answered, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.” ","bó kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Hwenu e mi ɖi nǔ nú Jezu ɔ́, Mawu ná Yɛsinsɛn mi a?” Bɔ yě yǐ gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Yɛsinsɛn ɖé tó tíin hǔn, mǐ se kpɔ́n gbeɖé ǎ.” "
"So Paul asked, “Then what baptism did you receive?” “John's baptism,” they replied. ",Pɔ́lu ka kanbyɔ́ yě ɖɔ: “Yɛhwesin tɛ́ mi ka lɛ lo?” Bɔ yě yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Yɛhwesin Jǎan tɔn wɛ mǐ lɛ.” 
"Paul said, “John's baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.” ","Pɔ́lu ka ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Yɛhwesin kɔ lɛ́ sín hwɛ mɛtɔn lɛ́ɛ gúdo tɔn wɛ Jǎan lɛ nú mɛ, bó ɖɔ nú togun ɔ́ ɖɔ mɛ e ɖo gúdo émítɔn jǎwe ɔ́ wɛ yě ná ɖi nǔ ná; mɛ énɛ́ wɛ nyí Jezu.” "
"On hearing this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. ","Ée yě se mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě lɛ yɛhwesin ɖo Aklúnɔ Jezu nyǐkɔ mɛ. "
"When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied. ","Pɔ́lu ka ɖó alɔ yě jí, bɔ Yɛsinsɛn wá yě jǐ, bɔ yě jɛ gbe ɖěvo dó jí, bó jɛ xó e Mawu ɖɔ nú yě ɔ́ ɖɔ jí. "
There were about twelve men in all. ,Yě bǐ ná yi gbɛtɔ́ wěwe mɔ̌. 
"Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God. ","Pɔ́lu nɔ yi kplɔ́ngbasá, bó nɔ ɖo xó ɖɔ wɛ kpódó jiɖiɖe kpó káká nú sun atɔn; é nɔ ɖɔ nǔ e kan axɔ́súɖuɖu Mawu tɔn ɔ́ sín xó, bó nɔ́ tɛ́nkpɔ́n nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ ná mɔ nǔgbó nú xó e ɖɔ wɛ é ɖe é. "
But some of them became obstinate,Fon
"This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord. ","Nǔ nyí mɔ̌ xɔ xwe we, káká bɔ mɛ e ɖo Azíi gbé jí lɛ́ɛ bǐ: Jwifu lɛ́ɛ kpódó mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ kpán se Aklúnɔxó ɔ́. "
"God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, ","Mawu nɔ́ jlɛ́ nǔ ɖaxó ɖaxó lɛ́ɛ gbɔn Pɔ́lu jí, "
"so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them. ","káká bɔ nú yě sɔ́ avɔ abǐ lɛ̌nsuví e jɛ Pɔ́lu wú ɔ́, ɖě dó azinzɔnnɔ ɖé wú ɔ́, azɔn tɔn nɔ gbɔ, bɔ yɛ nyanya ɖo mɛɖé jí ɔ́, é nɔ́ gosín mɛ ɔ́ jí. "
"Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, “In the name of Jesus, whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out.” ","Jwifu ɖé lɛ́ɛ ká tíin, bó nɔ́ ɖo dǐndán kpé wɛ, bó nɔ́ ɖo yɛ nyanya nya sín mɛ lɛ́ɛ jí wɛ; yě lɔmɔ̌ wá jɛ Aklúnɔ Jezu nyǐkɔ ylɔ́ jí, bó ná dó nya yɛ nyanya sín mɛ lɛ́ɛ jí; yě nɔ́ ɖɔ nú yɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ: “Un ɖe gbe dó mi; mi tɔ́n ɖo Jezu e xó Pɔ́lu nɔ ɖɔ ɔ́ sín nyǐkɔ mɛ.” "
"Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this. ",(Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Ceva ɔ́ sín vǐ súnnu tɛ́nwe lɛ́ɛ wɛ nɔ ɖo mɔ̌ bló wɛ.) 
"One day the evil spirit answered them, “Jesus I know, and I know about Paul, but who are you?” ","Lo ɔ́, yɛ nyanya ɔ́ gblɔ́n nú yě ɖɔ: “Jezu ɔ́, un tunwun i, bó tunwun mɛ e Pɔ́lu nyí é; bɔ midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mɛ nǎhún mi ka nyí?” "
Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding. ,"Bɔ nya e jí yɛ nyanya ɔ́ ɖe ɔ́ zɔn yě jí, bɔ hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n tɔn hú gǎn yě bǐ tɔn; é xo yě káká, bó gblé wǔ yě, bó ɖe yě nyi mɛ̌, bɔ yě hɔn tɔ́n sín xwé ɔ́ gbe. "
"When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor. ","Jwifu kpódó Glɛ̌sinu e ɖo Efɛ́zi lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpán wɛ se nǔ énɛ́ e jɛ ɔ́; énɛ́ ɔ́, xɛsi jɛ yě bǐ jǐ, bɔ yě sɔ́ Aklúnɔ Jezu sín nyǐkɔ su. "
Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed their evil deeds. ,"Yě mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ gěgé nɔ́ wá ɖɔ hwɛ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ, lobo nɔ ɖɔ nǔ e yě ko nɔ wa nyi do ɖ'ayǐ lɛ́ɛ ɖo agbawungba. "
"A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas. ","Majíkiblótɔ́ gěgé nɔ bɛ́ majíkiwéma yětɔn lɛ́ɛ wá, bó nɔ́ dó zo, ɖo mɛ bǐ nukún mɛ; yě lɛ̌n wěma énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ sín akwɛ́ kpɔ́n, bó mɔ ɖɔ é ná yi gankwɛ́ adɔ̌kpo we děgba we afɔwó (50.000) mɔ̌. "
In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power. ,"Lě e Aklúnɔxó ɔ́ nɔ́ ɖo gbigba kpé wɛ kpódó acɛ kpó, bó nɔ́ ɖo hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n tɔn ɖe xlɛ́ gbɔn wɛ ɔ́ nɛ́. "
"After all this had happened, Paul decided to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia. “After I have been there,” he said, “I must visit Rome also.” ","Ée nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ jɛ gúdo ɔ́, Pɔ́lu ɖɔ émí ná gbɔn Masedwani kpódó Akáyi kpán gbé jí, bó ná yi Jeluzalɛ́mu. É ka lɛ́ ɖɔ: “Un yi dɔ̌n ɔ́, un ɖó ná wá yi Hlɔ̌ma lɔmɔ̌.” "
"He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed in the province of Asia a little longer. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, é sɛ́ mɛ e nɔ dó alɔ ɛ lɛ́ɛ we dó Masedwani; yě mɛ we énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ wɛ nyí: Timɔtée kpódó Elasíti kpán; é ɖésúnɔ ka cí Azíi fínɛ́ kpɛɖé. "
About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way. ,Hwenɛ́nu wɛ hunnyahunnya ɖaxó ɖé tíin ɖó Aklúnɔ sín ali ɔ́ wútu. 
"A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought in no little business for the craftsmen. ","Nya nǔtuntɔ́ ɖé tíin, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Demɛtliwúsi; é nɔ sɔ́ kpatágan dó tun vodún e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Aatemísi é sín xɔ kpɛví kpɛví ɖé lɛ́ɛ ná bó nɔ́ sa; énɛ́ ɔ́ nɔ́ zɔ́n bɔ é nɔ dɔn akwɛ́ gěgé wá nú azɔ̌watɔ́ lɛ́ɛ. "
"He called them together, along with the workmen in related trades, and said: “Men, you know we receive a good income from this business. ","Nya énɛ́ wá kplé mɛ e nɔ wa azɔ̌ xá ɛ lɛ́ɛ, kpódó azɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́ watɔ́ e ɖo to ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ kpó, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Xɔ́ntɔn ce lɛ́ɛ mi, mi tunwun ɖɔ azɔ̌ élɔ́ wɛ nɔ dɔn akwɛ́ wá nú mǐ. "
And you see and hear how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia. He says that man-made gods are no gods at all. ,"Mi ka ɖo nǔ e dó sin wɛ nya Pɔ́lu énɛ́ ɖe ɔ́ mɔ wɛ, bó ɖo sise wɛ: é sɔ́ xó tɔn dó gblé tamɛ nú mɛ gěgé; ényí Efɛ́zi fí kɛ́ɖɛ́ wɛ ǎ, ɖibla gbɔn Azíi gbé ɔ́ bǐ jǐ wɛ, ɖó é nɔ́ ɖo ɖiɖɔ nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ ɖɔ nǔmɛsɛn e mǐ nɔ́ sɔ́ alɔ dó bló ná lɛ́ɛ kún nyí nǔ è nǎ sɛn ɖé ó. "
"There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited, and the goddess herself, who is worshiped throughout the province of Asia and the world, will be robbed of her divine majesty.” ","Nú mǐ ma nyɔ́ wa ǎ ɔ́, ényí azɔ̌ mǐtɔn kɛ́ɖɛ́ wɛ é ná hɛn gblé ǎ; lo ɔ́, mɛɖé sɔ́ ná ké ya nú vodún ɖaxó Aatemísi sín xɔ ɔ́ lɔmɔ̌ ǎ, bɔ vodún énɛ́ ɔ́ ɖésú e mɛ e ko ɖo Azíi gbé ɔ́ bǐ jí, kpódó mɛ e ko ɖo gbɛ ɔ́ bǐ mɛ lɛ́ɛ kpán nɔ́ sɛn ɔ́ sɔ́ ná ɖó wi ɖé ta ǎ.” "
"When they heard this, they were furious and began shouting: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” ","Ée yě se mɔ̌ ɔ́, xomɛ sin yě, bɔ yě jɛ xó sú jí bó nɔ́ ɖɔ: “Aatemísi Efɛ́zinu lɛ́ɛ tɔn ɔ́ wɛ nyí nǔ ɖaxó.” "
"Soon the whole city was in an uproar. The people seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia, and rushed as one man into the theater. ","Bɔ to ɔ́ bǐ xozǐn, bó nyi ahwan ɖidó tokplégbasá; yě wlí Gayiwúsi kpódó Alisitáki kpán, bó dɔn yě hɛn yi fínɛ́. Yě mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, Masedwaninu wɛ yě nyí, bɔ yě kpó Pɔ́lu kpó zɔn. "
"Paul wanted to appear before the crowd, but the disciples would not let him. ","Pɔ́lu ka jló ná yi fí e togun ɔ́ kplé ɖe ɔ́; lo ɔ́, yě mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ gbɛ́ n'i. "
"Even some of the officials of the province, friends of Paul, sent him a message begging him not to venture into the theater. ",Xɔ́ntɔn tɔn axɔ́súzɔ́watɔ́ Azíinu ɖé lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌ sɛ́ wɛn dó e ɖɔ é ní kɛnklɛ́n bó ma yi tokplégbasá ɔ́ gbeɖé ó. 
"The assembly was in confusion: Some were shouting one thing, some another. Most of the people did not even know why they were there. ","Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, mɛ ɖě sú xó, bó ɖɔ ɖě ɔ́, mɛ ɖě nɔ́ sú xó bó nɔ́ ɖɔ ɖěvo, bɔ agun ɔ́ bǐ fan. Mɛ gěgé ɖo yě mɛ, bó tlɛ tunwun nǔ e wú è kplé lɔ é ǎ. "
"The Jews pushed Alexander to the front, and some of the crowd shouted instructions to him. He motioned for silence in order to make a defense before the people. ","Mɛ ɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖo agun ɔ́ mɛ, bó tín xó ɔ́ mɛ nú Alɛsándlu e Jwifu lɛ́ɛ sísɛ́ dó nukɔn é; énɛ́ ɔ́, Alɛsándlu bló alɔ nú yě, bó jló ná ɖɔ xó dó hwlɛ́n yě gán ɖo togun ɔ́ nukɔn. "
"But when they realized he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” ","Lo ɔ́, ée yě mɔ ɖɔ Jwifu wɛ é nyí ɔ́, yě bǐ sú xó zɛ̌ɛ́n, bó ɖo xó ɖokpó ɔ́ ɖɔ wɛ káká nú ganxixo we mɔ̌; yě nɔ́ ɖɔ: “Aatemísi Efɛ́zinu lɛ́ɛ tɔn ɔ́ wɛ nyí nǔ ɖaxó!” "
"The city clerk quieted the crowd and said: “Men of Ephesus, doesn't all the world know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image, which fell from heaven? ","Wěgbójínɔtɔ́ to ɔ́ tɔn ka hwíhwɛ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ bó ɖɔ: “Efɛ́zinu lɛ́ɛ mi, mɛ bǐ tunwun ɖɔ Efɛ́zi to ɔ́ wɛ nɔ cɔ́ vodún ɖaxó Aatemísi sín xɔ ɔ́, kpódó akpajlɛ́ tɔn e jɛ ayǐ sín jǐxwé ɔ́ kpán. "
"Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to be quiet and not do anything rash. ","Mɛ ɖé sixú gbɛ́ énɛ́ ǎ; énɛ́ wú ɔ́, mǐ ɖó ná hwíhwɛ́ mǐɖée, bó gɔn nǔ wa ma lin tamɛ kpɔ́n. "
"You have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess. ","Mɛ élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ e mi kplá hɛn wá fí ɔ́, yě ɖu su ɖé nú vodún mǐtɔn ǎ, yě ka nylá nu ɖé dó vodún mǐtɔn wú ǎ. "
"If, then, Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anybody, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They can press charges. ","Ényí Demɛtliwúsi kpódó nǔtuntɔ́ e nɔ́ wa azɔ̌ xá ɛ lɛ́ɛ kpán ɖó nǔɖé dó mɛɖé wú ɔ́, hwɛɖɔxɔ lɛ́ɛ ɖo nuvo; hwɛɖɔtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ lɔ ka ɖe; yě ní yi ylɔ́ hwɛ ɖo fínɛ́. "
"If there is anything further you want to bring up, it must be settled in a legal assembly. ","Ényí mi ka lɛ́ ɖo nǔ ɖěvo ba wɛ ɔ́, to ɔ́ ko kplé ɔ́, è nǎ ɖɔ gbo. "
"As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of today's events. In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion, since there is no reason for it.” ","Mǐ ma nyɔ́ bló ǎ ɔ́, è nǎ ɖɔ to hɛn dán wɛ mǐ ɖe, ɖó nǔ e jɛ égbé ɔ́ wú; nǔ e wú è blǒ kplé élɔ́ din ɔ́, é tíin nyǐ ǎ; mǐ ka sixú mɔ xó jɔ xó ɖé, dó tín nǔ e wú mǐ kplé ɖo fí din ɔ́ mɛ ǎ.” "
"After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.When the uproar had ended, Paul sent for the disciples and, after encouraging them, said good-by and set out for Macedonia. ","Ée é ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, é nya mɛ lɛ́ɛ.Ée zǐngídi ɔ́ wá xwɛ ɔ́, Pɔ́lu ylɔ́ yě mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ kplé, bó dó wǔsyɛ́n lanmɛ nú yě, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ émí ná yi bó wá, lobo ɖidó Masedwani. "
"He traveled through that area, speaking many words of encouragement to the people, and finally arrived in Greece, ","É gbɔn fí énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ, bó ɖɔ xó gěgé ɖo fínɛ́, bó dó dó wǔsyɛ́n lanmɛ nú mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ, bó wá yi Glɛ̌si yíkúngban jí. "
"where he stayed three months. Because the Jews made a plot against him just as he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to go back through Macedonia. ","É xɔ sun atɔn ɖo fínɛ́; é ka wá ɖo nǔ sɔ́ wɛ bó ná dó tɔjíhún yi Silíi gbé jí, bó se ɖɔ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ blá gbě émítɔn; énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, é ɖɔ émí ná lɛ́ kɔ gbɔn Masedwani. "
"He was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy also, and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia. ","Mɛ e nyi i lɛ́ɛ ɖíe: Sopatlɔ́si Beléenu e nyí Pilusi ví é; Alisitáki kpódó Sekúndúsi kpó, Tɛsalonikinu wɛ nú yě; Gayiwúsi Dɛɛbenu ɔ́, kpódó Timɔtée kpó; Ticíku kpódó Tlofímu kpó, Azíinu wɛ nú yě. "
These men went on ahead and waited for us at Troas. ,"Mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ jɛ nukɔn, bó yi nɔ te kpɔ́n mǐ ɖo Tlowasi. "
"But we sailed from Philippi after the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and five days later joined the others at Troas, where we stayed seven days. ","Ée wɔ̌xúxú e mɛ è ma dó tɔ́n ǎ é sín xwe wá yi ɔ́, mǐ ɖésúnɔ ɔ́, mǐ dó tɔjíhún ɖo Filípu, bó xɔ azǎn atɔ́ɔ́n ɖo tɔ jí, bó wá mɔ yě ɖo Tlowasi, bó nɔ fínɛ́ xɔ azǎn tɛ́nwe. "
"On the first day of the week we came together to break bread. Paul spoke to the people and, because he intended to leave the next day, kept on talking until midnight. ","Azǎn nukɔntɔn e ɖo aklúnɔzángbla mɛ ɔ́, gbadanu tɔn ɔ́, mǐ kó kplé bó ná ɖu kɔnɖókpɔ́ nǔɖuɖu ɔ́; Pɔ́lu ka ɖó ná yi ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn zǎnzǎn; é ka ɖo xó ɖɔ xá yě mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ wɛ káká bɔ zǎn vlɔ́ ɖó we.

There were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting. ,Zogbɛ́n gěgé ɖo títá ɖo xɔ e mɛ mǐ kplé ɖe ɖo síngbó jí é. 
"Seated in a window was a young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on. When he was sound asleep, he fell to the ground from the third story and was picked up dead. ","Nyaví dɔ̌nkpɛvú ɖé ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n ɖo flɛtɛ́li nu; è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Etíki.

"Paul went down, threw himself on the young man and put his arms around him. “Don't be alarmed,” he said. “He's alive!” ","Pɔ́lu ka jɛ te, bó fɛ, bó zé e dó awa mɛ bó ɖɔ: “Ayi mitɔn ní ma gbadó ó, ɖó é kpo ɖo gbɛ.” "
"Then he went upstairs again and broke bread and ate. After talking until daylight, he left. ","Énɛ́ gúdo ɔ́, Pɔ́lu lɛ́ yi síngbó ɔ́ jí, bó kán wɔ̌xúxú bó ɖu. É ka lɛ́ ɖɔ xó nú yě káká bɔ ayǐ hɔ́n, lobo ɖidó. "
The people took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted. ,"Mɛ lɛ́ɛ ka kplá nyaví dɔ̌nkpɛvú ɔ́, bɔ é ɖo gbɛ; nǔ énɛ́ dó wǔsyɛ́n lanmɛ nú yě bǐ. "
"We went on ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, where we were going to take Paul aboard. He had made this arrangement because he was going there on foot. ","Mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mǐ jɛ nukɔn nú Pɔ́lu, bó dó tɔjíhún, bó ɖidó Asɔ́si; fínɛ́ wɛ é ɖésúnɔ kó ɖɔ émí ná zɔn afɔ wá, bɔ mǐ ná zé émí ɖe. "
"When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard and went on to Mitylene. ","Hwenu e mǐ wá kplé ɖo Asɔ́si ɔ́, mǐ sɔ́ ɛ dó tɔjíhún mɛ yi Mitilɛ́nu. "
"The next day we set sail from there and arrived off Kios. The day after that we crossed over to Samos, and on the following day arrived at Miletus. ","Mǐ gosín fínɛ́, bɔ ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn ɔ́, mǐ yi Cio nukɔn. Azǎn atɔngɔ́ ɔ́ gbe ɔ́, mǐ yi Samɔ́si, bó wá Milɛ ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn. "
"Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of Asia, for he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost. ","Đó Pɔ́lu ɖɔ émí ná gbɔn Efɛ́zi nukɔn dín, bó ma wá gú hwenu ɖo Azíi ó; ɖó é ɖo hwlɛndó jí, bónú é kpé wú ɔ́, é ná ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu ɖo Jwifu lɛ́ɛ sín xwe e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Pantekótu ɔ́ gbe. "
"From Miletus, Paul sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church. ","Pɔ́lu sɛ́ mɛ dó sín Milɛ, nú yě ní yi Efɛ́zi, bó yi ylɔ́ agunnukɔntɔ́ lɛ́ɛ wá. "
"When they arrived, he said to them: “You know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I came into the province of Asia. ","Ée yě wǎ gɔ̌n tɔn ɔ́, é ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Lě e un nɔ mi mɛ gbɔn sín gbe e gbe un wá Azíi ɔ́, mi ɖě sɔ́ dán ɛ ǎ. "
"I served the Lord with great humility and with tears, although I was severely tested by the plots of the Jews. ","Un nɔ sɛn Aklúnɔ ɖo mɛɖée sɔ́ hwe mɛ; un nɔ sɛn ɛ kpó avǐ kpó, bó nɔ́ sɛn ɛ ɖo wǔvɛ́ e mɔɖónúmɛ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn nɔ dɔn wá nú mì lɛ́ɛ é tɛ́ntin. "
You know that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house. ,"Nǔ e ná nyí le nú mi ɔ́, un hwlá ɖěbǔ dó mi ǎ: un ɖɔ bǐ nú mi, bó kplɔ́n bǐ mi ɖo agbawungba kpódó xwé mitɔn lɛ́ɛ gbe kpó. "
I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus. ,"Un ɖɔ nú Jwifu lɛ́ɛ, bó ɖɔ nú mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ yě ɖó ná lɛ́ kɔ sín hwɛ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ gúdo, bó húzú jɛ Mawu li jí, bó ɖi nǔ nú Aklúnɔ mǐtɔn Jezu. "
"“And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there. ","Éɖíe! Din ɔ́, un xwe Jeluzalɛ́mu; ɖó Yɛsinsɛn ɖɔ nú mì ɖɔ nyi ɖó ná yi dandan; un ko tunwun nǔ e ɖo ná gbo mì wɛ ɖo dɔ̌n é ǎ. "
I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me. ,"Nǔ e un tunwun kpowun ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ: ɖo to ɖokpó ɖokpó mɛ ɔ́, Yɛsinsɛn nɔ ɖo ɖiɖɔ nú mì wɛ ɖɔ gankpá mɛ yiyi kpódó yajiji gěgé kpán ɖo te kpɔ́n mì. "
"However, I consider my life worth nothing to me, if only I may finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me–the task of testifying to the gospel of God's grace. ","Amɔ̌, gbɛ nyɛtɔn ɔ́ wɛ nyí nǔɖé nú mì ǎ; éé ɖo tají ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ má kó sixú dó wezun e ɖo afɔ ce nu ɔ́ yi fó, bó wa azɔ̌ e Aklúnɔ Jezu sɔ́ dó así nú mì ɔ́ yi fó; é wɛ nyí ɖɔ má jlá Wɛn Ɖagbe e ɖɔ xó dó fɛ́nú Mawu tɔn wú é.

“Now I know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever see me again. ,"“Un gbɔn mi bǐ tɛ́ntin, bó ɖɔ axɔ́súɖuɖu Mawu tɔn sín xó nú mi; amɔ̌ din ɔ́, mi ɖě sɔ́ ná mɔ mì ǎ. "
"Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of all men. ","Énɛ́ wú wɛ un ɖo ɖiɖɔ nú mi wɛ égbé ɖɔ ényí mɛɖé dɔn ɖo mi mɛ ɔ́, é kún sɔ́ kan mì ó! "
For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God. ,Đó un jlá tito Mawu tɔn ɔ́ bǐ mi
"Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood.

"What grieved them most was his statement that they would never see his face again. Then they accompanied him to the ship.After we had torn ourselves away from them, we put out to sea and sailed straight to Cos. The next day we went to Rhodes and from there to Patara.

"Coming over to us, he took Paul's belt, tied his own hands and feet with it and said, “The Holy Spirit says, ‘In this way the Jews of Jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt and will hand him over to the Gentiles.’ ” ","É wá mɔ mǐ, bó zé gǒjíblánú Pɔ́lu tɔn dó blá afɔ kpódó alɔ kpán nú éɖée, bó ɖɔ: “Nǔ e Yɛsinsɛn ɖɔ ɔ́ ɖíe: mɛ e tɔn nyí gǒjíblánú élɔ́ ɔ́, lě e Jwifu lɛ́ɛ na blá ɛ gbɔn ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu, bó ná jó e nú mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ é ɖíe.” "
"When we heard this, we and the people there pleaded with Paul not to go up to Jerusalem. ","Ée mǐ se mɔ̌ ɔ́, mǐ kpó to ɔ́ mɛ nu lɛ́ɛ kpó sa vo nú Pɔ́lu ɖɔ ní ma yi Jeluzalɛ́mu ó. "
"Then Paul answered, “Why are you weeping and breaking my heart?

"After this, we got ready and went up to Jerusalem. ","Mǐ nɔ fínɛ́ xɔ azǎn yɔywɛ ɖé, bó sɔ́nǔ, bó ɖidó Jeluzalɛ́mu. "
"Some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us and brought us to the home of Mnason, where we were to stay. He was a man from Cyprus and one of the early disciples.

"The next day Paul and the rest of us went to see James, and all the elders were present. ","Ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn ɔ́, Pɔ́lu kpó mǐ kpó yi Jaki xwé, bɔ agunmɛxó lɛ́ɛ bǐ kplé ɖo fínɛ́. "
Paul greeted them and reported in detail what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. ,"Pɔ́lu dó gbe yě, bɔ nǔ e Mawu jlɛ́ ɖo mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ tɛ́ntin gbɔn gbla tɔn mɛ ɔ́, é wlí ɖokpó ɖokpó ɖɔ nú yě. "
"When they heard this, they praised God. Then they said to Paul: “You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews have believed, and all of them are zealous for the law. ","Ée yě se xó nɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, yě bǐ kpa susu nú Mawu, bó ka ɖɔ nú Pɔ́lu ɖɔ: “A mɔ a nɔví? Jwifu lɛ́ɛ afatɔ́n afatɔ́n donu nabí ɖé wɛ ɖi nǔ; yě bǐ ka lɛ́ ɖó kan dó Mɔyízi sɛ́n ɔ́ wú. "
"They have been informed that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to turn away from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or live according to our customs. ","È ka wá ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ hwi nɔ kplɔ́n nǔ Jwifu e ɖo to ɖěvo mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ yě ma sɔ́ nyi Mɔyízisɛ́n ɔ́ ɖě ó; yě má sɔ́ gbo ada nú vǐ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖě ó, yě ma ka sɔ́ xwedó hwɛndo tɔ́gbó mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ tɔn ɖě ó.

"What shall we do? They will certainly hear that you have come, ","Nɛ̌ mǐ ná wa gbɔn din? Đó dandan mɛ ɔ́, yě ná se ɖɔ a lɛ́ kɔ wá. "
so do what we tell you. There are four men with us who have made a vow. ,"Hǔn, bó bló nǔ e mǐ ná ɖɔ nú we ɔ́. Nya ɛnɛ ɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖo mǐ mɛ, bó ko dó akpá nú Mawu. "
"Take these men, join in their purification rites and pay their expenses, so that they can have their heads shaved. Then everybody will know there is no truth in these reports about you, but that you yourself are living in obedience to the law. ","Kplá yě, bónú hwi kpódó yě kpán mi ná yi slá wǔ; a nǎ sú akwɛ́ e mi ná zán ɖo fínɛ́ ɔ́ bǐ, bónú yě ná sixú xwlɛ́ ɖa; énɛ́ ɔ́, mɛ bǐ ná tunwun ɖɔ nǔ e è ɖɔ dó wú we ɔ́ ɖě kún nyí nǔgbó ó, bó ná mɔ ɖɔ hwi lɔ nɔ nyi Mɔyízisɛ́n lɛ́ɛ.

"As for the Gentile believers, we have written to them our decision that they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality.” ","Mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ, bó ka ɖi nǔ nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mǐ kó wlán nǔ e mǐ kplé bó ɖɔ ɔ́ sɛ́ dó yě ɖɔ yě ní má ɖu nǔ e è xwlé vodún ɔ́ ɖě ó; yě ní má ɖu hun ó; yě ní má ɖu kanlin e è glɔ̌n agbɔ̌n ná bo hu lɛ́ɛ ɖě sín lan ó, yě ní má ka lɛ aga ó.” "
The next day Paul took the men and purified himself along with them. Then he went to the temple to give notice of the date when the days of purification would end and the offering would be made for each of them. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, Pɔ́lu kplá nya ɛnɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ, bɔ ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn ɔ́, é slá wǔ xá yě, bó byɔ́ sinsɛnxɔ mɛ.

"When the seven days were nearly over, some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul at the temple. They stirred up the whole crowd and seized him, ","Azǎn tɛ́nwe lɛ́ɛ wɛ ɖo ná vɔ wɛ kɛ́ɖɛ́, bɔ Jwifu Azíi gbé jí tɔn lɛ́ɛ wá mɔ Pɔ́lu ɖo sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́ mɛ, bó fɔ́n togun ɔ́ bǐ dó jǐ tɔn, lobo wlí i. "
"shouting, “Men of Israel, help us! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against our people and our law and this place. And besides, he has brought Greeks into the temple area and defiled this holy place.” ","Yě nɔ́ sú xó ɖɔ: “Izlayɛ́li ví lɛ́ɛ mi, mi wá lóóo!

(They had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul and assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple area.) ,"(Yě ɖɔ mɔ̌, ɖó yě ko mɔ Tlofímu Efɛ́zinu ɔ́ kpódó Pɔ́lu kpán ɖo toxo ɔ́ mɛ ɖ'ayǐ, bɔ yě vɛdó ɖɔ Pɔ́lu kplá ɛ byɔ́ sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́ mɛ wɛ sín.) "
"The whole city was aroused, and the people came running from all directions. Seizing Paul, they dragged him from the temple, and immediately the gates were shut.

"While they were trying to kill him, news reached the commander of the Roman troops that the whole city of Jerusalem was in an uproar. ","Yě ɖo biba ná hu i wɛ, bɔ è wá ɖɔ nú ahwangán ɖaxó e kpa acɛ nú ahwankánɖó Hlɔ̌ma tɔn ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Jeluzalɛ́mu to ɔ́ bǐ xo zǐn.” "
"He at once took some officers and soldiers and ran down to the crowd. When the rioters saw the commander and his soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.

"Some in the crowd shouted one thing and some another, and since the commander could not get at the truth because of the uproar, he ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks.

"As the soldiers were about to take Paul into the barracks, he asked the commander, “May I say something to you?” “Do you speak Greek?” he replied.

"Having received the commander's permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the crowd. When they were all silent, he said to them in Aramaic:“Brothers and fathers, listen now to my defense.” ","Ahwangán ɔ́ ka ná gbe tɔn ɛ, bɔ Pɔ́lu nɔ te ɖo kpekán lɛ́ɛ jí, bó bló alɔ nú togun ɔ́, bɔ mɛ bǐ xwɛ.

"When they heard him speak to them in Aramaic, they became very quiet. Then Paul said: ","Ée yě mɔ ɖɔ alamugbe mɛ ɖɔ xó nú émí dó wɛ é ɖe ɔ́, yě bǐ lɛ́ cí tóó d'é jí, bɔ Pɔ́lu ɖɔ: "

"The crowd listened to Paul until he said this. Then they raised their voices and shouted, “Rid the earth of him! He's not fit to live!” ","Mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖótó Pɔ́lu káká jɛ fínɛ́, lo ɔ́, yě jɛ xó sú jí ɖɔ: “Mi bú nya énɛ́; mi hu i; é nyí mɛ bó ná nɔ gbɛ ǎ!” "
"As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air, ","Yě ɖo xó sú wɛ, bó ɖo avɔ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ nyi dó jǐ wɛ, lobo ɖo kɔ́gúdu nyi dó jǐ wɛ; "
the commander ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks. He directed that he be flogged and questioned in order to find out why the people were shouting at him like this. ,"bɔ ahwangán ɖaxó ɔ́ ɖɔ è ní kplá Pɔ́lu byɔ́ ahwankpá ɔ́ mɛ, bó xo e, bó kan nǔ byɔ́ ɛ, nú é ná ɖɔ nǔ e wútu mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖo xó sú dó jǐ tɔn wɛ sɔ mɔ̌ é. "
"As they stretched him out to flog him, Paul said to the centurion standing there, “Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn't even been found guilty?” ","Ée yě blá Pɔ́lu, bó ɖo nǎ xó e wɛ ɔ́, é kanbyɔ́ sɔ́ja kanwekogán ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Sɛ́n ɔ́ ná gbe ɖɔ è ní xo Hlɔ̌ma toví ɖó lanbá wú ma to ɖó hwɛ n'i a?” "
"When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and reported it. “What are you going to do?” he asked. “This man is a Roman citizen.” ","Ée sɔ́ja kanwekogán énɛ́ se mɔ̌ ɔ́, é yi mɔ ahwangán ɖaxó Hlɔ̌manu ɔ́, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Étɛ́ ná dó sin wɛ a ka ɖe nɛ́? Nya ɔ́ Hlɔ̌manu wɛ hǔn.” "
"The commander went to Paul and asked, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” “Yes, I am,” he answered. ","Bɔ ahwangán ɖaxó Hlɔ̌manu ɔ́ wá Pɔ́lu gɔ́n, bó kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Hlɔ̌manu wɛ a nyǐ nǔgbó a?” Pɔ́lu ka yí gbe ɖɔ: “Ɛɛn Hlɔ̌manu wɛ un nyí.” "
"Then the commander said, “I had to pay a big price for my citizenship.” “But I was born a citizen,” Paul replied. ","Bɔ ahwangán ɖaxó Hlɔ̌manu ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Nyɛ ɔ́, akwɛ́ mɔ̌kpán wɛ un zán, cóbɔ è wǎ xa mì dó Hlɔ̌manu lɛ́ɛ mɛ.” Pɔ́lu ka ɖɔ: “Nyɛ ɔ́, Hlɔ̌ma ví jiji wɛ un nyí.” "
"Those who were about to question him withdrew immediately. The commander himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put Paul, a Roman citizen, in chains. ","Tlóló ɔ́, mɛ e ko ɖo nǎ xo e wɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ yá wǔ jó agɔ yi gǔdo bléwún. Xɛsi jɛ ahwangán ɖaxó Hlɔ̌manu ɔ́ ɖésú jí, ɖó é wá mɔ ɖɔ Hlɔ̌ma toví wɛ émí zɔ́n bɔ è blǎ. "
"The next day, since the commander wanted to find out exactly why Paul was being accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to assemble. Then he brought Paul and had him stand before them.Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin and said, “My brothers, I have fulfilled my duty to God in all good conscience to this day.” ","Ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn ɔ́, ahwangán ɖaxó Hlɔ̌manu ɔ́ jló ná tunwun nǔ e sín hwɛ dó Pɔ́lu wɛ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ɖe tawun ɔ́; é zɔ́n bɔ è tun i, lobo zɔ́n, bɔ è kplé vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó toxóɖɔtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpó, bɔ é kplá Pɔ́lu, bó sɔ́ ɛ ɖó nukɔn yětɔn.Pɔ́lu bɔ nukún nyi toxóɖɔtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ wú, bó ɖɔ: “Nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, ayi ce xo hun xá mì ɖo nǔ ɖěbǔ mɛ ɖo Mawu nukɔn káká jɛ égbé ǎ.” "
At this the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth. ,"Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó Ananíyasi ka ɖɔ nú mɛ e ɖo Pɔ́lu kpá lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ yě ní gba nu n'i, "
"Then Paul said to him, “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck!” ","bɔ Pɔ́lu ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Hwi mɛ e kwíji ɖo ayi mɛ, bó ka ɖo mɛ mímɛ́ bló wɛ ɖo wěxo ɔ́, dǒglin e è sá nǔ wěwé dó ɔ́ ɖɔhun wɛ a cí; Mawu wɛ ná xo we; a jínjɔ́n ayǐ, bó jló ná ɖɔ hwɛ xá mì lě e sɛ́n ɔ́ zɔ́n gbɔn é; sɛ́n ɔ́ ka zɔ́n ɖɔ è xo mì ǎ, bɔ hwɛ ka zɔ́n ɖɔ è ní xo mì.” "
"Those who were standing near Paul said, “You dare to insult God's high priest?” ",Mɛ e ɖo Pɔ́lu kpá lɛ́ɛ ka ɖɔ: “A zun vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó ɔ́!” 
"Paul replied, “Brothers, I did not realize that he was the high priest; for it is written: ‘Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people.’ ” ","Pɔ́lu ka yí gbe ɖɔ: “Nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, un tunwun ɖɔ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó wɛ ǎ; ɖó è ko wlán ɖɔ: ‘Ma ɖɔ xó nyanya dó togán towe wú ó.’ ” "
"Then Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees and the others Pharisees, called out in the Sanhedrin, “My brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee. I stand on trial because of my hope in the resurrection of the dead.” ","Ée Pɔ́lu ka mɔ ɖɔ, ɖo toxóɖɔgbɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, mɛ ɖě nyí Saduseɛn, mɛ ɖě ka nyí Falizyɛn ɔ́, é sú xó ɖo toxóɖɔgbɛ́ ɔ́ tɛ́ntin, bó ɖɔ: “Nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, nyɛ ɔ́, Falizyɛn gbɛ́ta ɔ́ mɛ wɛ un ɖe, bó ka lɛ́ nyí Falizyɛn ví jiji.

"When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. ","Ée é ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, nǔdindɔn byɔ́ Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ kpódó Saduseɛn lɛ́ɛ kpó tɛ́ntin, bɔ agun ɔ́ klán. "
"(The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, and that there are neither angels nor spirits, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.) ",(Đó Saduseɛn lɛ́ɛ nɔ ɖɔ mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ kún ɖo ná fɔ́n wɛ ɖě ó
"There was a great uproar, and some of the teachers of the law who were Pharisees stood up and argued vigorously. “We find nothing wrong with this man,” they said. “What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, xósúsú ɔ́ lɛ́ syɛ́n d'é jí; Falizyɛn sɛ́nkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ ɖé lɛ́ɛ sí te, bó gbɛ́ gbídígbídí ɖɔ jí: “Mǐ mɔ nǔ e nya élɔ́ wa nyi do ɔ́ ǎ; é sixú nyí ɖɔ yɛ ɖé abǐ wɛnsagun ɖé wɛ ná ko ɖɔ xó n'i.” "
The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them. He ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force and bring him into the barracks. ,"Zǐngídi ɔ́ ka wá ɖo syɛ́nsyɛ́n d'é jí wɛ, bɔ ahwangán ɖaxó ɔ́ jɛ xɛsi ɖi jí ɖɔ yě ma wá vúnvún Pɔ́lu ó, énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ é ylɔ́ sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ, bó zɔ́n ɖɔ yě ní wá ɖe Pɔ́lu sín mɛ lɛ́ɛ mɛ, bó kplá ɛ yi ɖó ahwankpá ɔ́ mɛ.

"The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, “Take courage! As you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome.” ","Gbe énɛ́ gbe zǎn mɛ ɔ́, Aklúnɔ tɔ́n dó Pɔ́lu jí, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Kpan akɔ́n; a ɖe kúnnu nú mì ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu fí; mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, a nǎ lɛ́ ɖe nú mì ɖo Hlɔ̌ma.” "
The next morning the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul. ,"Ée ayǐ ka wá hɔ́n ɔ́, Jwifu lɛ́ɛ blá gbě; yě ɖɔ, bó xwlé nǔ d'é jí ɖɔ, émí ma hu Pɔ́lu ǎ ɔ́, émí kún ná ɖu nǔ ɖěbǔ ó, émí kún ka ná nu sin ó. "
More than forty men were involved in this plot. ,Yě mɛ e blá gbě énɛ́ ɔ́ hú gbɛtɔ́ kanɖé (40). 
"They went to the chief priests and elders and said, “We have taken a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul. ","Yě yi mɔ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó agunnukɔntɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpán, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mǐ ɖó gbe kpɔ́, bó xwlé nǔ d'é jí ɖɔ mǐ ma hu Pɔ́lu ǎ ɔ́, mǐ kún ná ɖu nǔ ó. "
"Now then, you and the Sanhedrin petition the commander to bring him before you on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about his case. We are ready to kill him before he gets here.” ","Hǔn din ɔ́, midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ kpódó toxóɖɔgbɛ́ lɛ́ɛ kpó ní byɔ́ ahwangán ɖaxó ɔ́ ɖɔ ní kplá Pɔ́lu wá nú émí; mi ná ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ émí jló ná gbéjé xó tɔn kpɔ́n céɖécéɖé.

"But when the son of Paul's sister heard of this plot, he went into the barracks and told Paul. ","Pɔ́lu sín nɔví nyɔ̌nu sín vǐ súnnu ɖokpó ka se gbě e blá dó nylɔ́ tɔn wú wɛ yě ɖe ɔ́, bó yi gɔ̌n tɔn ɖo ahwankpá ɔ́ mɛ, lobo wlí ɖɔ n'i. "
"Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the commander; he has something to tell him.” ","Pɔ́lu ka ylɔ́ sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ sín gǎn ɖokpó, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Kplá nyaví élɔ́ yi ahwangán ɖaxó ɔ́ gɔ́n; é ɖó xó ɖé ná ɖɔ n'i.” "
"So he took him to the commander. The centurion said, “Paul, the prisoner, sent for me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.” ","Sɔ́jagán ɔ́ ka kplá nyaví ɔ́ yi ahwangán ɖaxó ɔ́ gɔ́n, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Gantɔ́ Pɔ́lu wɛ ylɔ́ mì, bó sɔ́ nyaví élɔ́ dó alɔ mɛ nú mì ɖɔ ma kplá ɛ wá nú we, ɖó é jló ná ɖɔ xó ɖé nú we.” "
"The commander took the young man by the hand, drew him aside and asked, “What is it you want to tell me?” ","Ahwangán ɖaxó ɔ́ ka hɛn nyaví ɔ́ sín alɔ, bó kplá ɛ jɛ vo, bó kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: “Étɛ́ a jlǒ ná ɖɔ nú mì?” "
He said: “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul before the Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about him. ,"Nyaví ɔ́ ka yí gbe ɖɔ: “Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ɖó gbe kpɔ́, bó ná byɔ́ we ɖɔ hwi ní kplá Pɔ́lu wá toxóɖɔgbɛ́ ɔ́ nukɔn sɔ, ɖi nǔ yě jló ná vɔ́ xó tɔn gbéjé kpɔ́n ganjí ɖɔhun. "
"Don't give in to them, because more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him. They have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They are ready now, waiting for your consent to their request.” ","Ma ka ɖótó xó yětɔn ó; ɖó mɛ yětɔn kanɖé (40) jɛjí ná tɔwu n'i.

"The commander dismissed the young man and cautioned him, “Don't tell anyone that you have reported this to me.” ","Ahwangán ɖaxó ɔ́ ka nyi nyaví ɔ́ sɛ́ dó xwé, bó dó sɛ́n n'i ɖɔ mɛɖé ní ma se nǔ e é wá ɖɔ nú émí din ɔ́ ɖo nu tɔn ó. "
"Then he called two of his centurions and ordered them, “Get ready a detachment of two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at nine tonight. ","Ahwangán ɖaxó ɔ́ ka wá ylɔ́ sɔ́ja kanwekogán we, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi kplé sɔ́ja afɔɖé (200), sɔ́ja sɔ́xátɔ́ kanɖé gban (70), kpódó sɔ́ja e nɔ hɛn hwǎn lɛ́ɛ afɔɖé (200) kpán ɖó te.

Provide mounts for Paul so that he may be taken safely to Governor Felix.” ,"Mi blá akpa nú sɔ́ ɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖ'ayǐ nú Pɔ́lu lɔmɔ̌, bó kplá ɛ yi tokpɔngán Felísi gɔ́n wǔyɛ́yɛ́ afɔyɛ́yɛ́.” "
He wrote a letter as follows: ,"É ka wlán wěma ɖokpó sɛ́ dó tokpɔngán ɔ́, bó ɖɔ d'é mɛ ɖɔ: "
"Claudius Lysias, To His Excellency, Governor Felix: Greetings. ","“Nyɛ Klódiwusi Lisiyási ɔ́, un ɖo gbe dó sɛ́ dó mɛsísí ce tokpɔngán Felísi wɛ. "
"This man was seized by the Jews and they were about to kill him, but I came with my troops and rescued him, for I had learned that he is a Roman citizen. ","Nya élɔ́ e un sɛ́ dó we ɔ́, Jwifu lɛ́ɛ wɛ wlí i, bó ɖo nǎ hu i wɛ, bɔ nyɛ kpódó ahwan ce lɛ́ɛ kpó yi tɛn tɔn mɛ, bó yí i sín alɔ yětɔn mɛ, ɖó un se ɖɔ Hlɔ̌manu wɛ. "
"I wanted to know why they were accusing him, so I brought him to their Sanhedrin. ","Un jló ná ba do nú xó ɔ́, bó ná tunwun nǔ e sín hwɛ dó e wɛ yě ɖe tawun ɔ́, bó kplá ɛ yi toxóɖɔgbɛ́ yětɔn nukɔn. "
"I found that the accusation had to do with questions about their law, but there was no charge against him that deserved death or imprisonment. ","Un wá mɔ ɖɔ nǔɖé lɛ́ɛ wú dó hwɛ ɛ dó wɛ yě ɖe, ɖo sɛ́n yětɔn mɛ. Lo ɔ́, nǔ e na zɔ́n bɔ è nǎ ɖó kúhwɛ n'i, abǐ è nǎ wlí i dó gankpá mɛ ɔ́, un mɔ ɖě ɖo wǔ tɔn ǎ. "
"When I was informed of a plot to be carried out against the man, I sent him to you at once. I also ordered his accusers to present to you their case against him. ","Ée è lɛ́ wá ɖɔ nú mì ɖɔ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ blá gbě tɔn ɔ́, un yǎ wǔ bo sɛ́ ɛ dó we, bó ka ɖɔ nú mɛ e ɖo hwɛ dó e wɛ lɛ́ɛ azɔn ɖokpó ɖɔ yě ní wá ylɔ́ hwɛ ɛ ɖo gɔ̌n towe.” "
"So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul with them during the night and brought him as far as Antipatris. ","Sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ ka bló nǔ e è zɔ́n yě lɛ́ɛ, bó kplá Pɔ́lu yi Antipatlisi zǎn énɛ́ mɛ. "
"The next day they let the cavalry go on with him, while they returned to the barracks. ","Ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn ɔ́, sɔ́ja e zɔn afɔ bo ɖo yě nyi wɛ lɛ́ɛ lɛ́ kɔ wá yi ahwankpá ɔ́ mɛ, bɔ yě mɛ e xá sɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kplá Pɔ́lu hɛn yi to ɔ́ mɛ. "
"When the cavalry arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and handed Paul over to him. ","Ée sɔ́xátɔ́ lɛ́ɛ yi Sezalée ɔ́, yě sɔ́ wěma ɔ́ nú tokpɔngán ɔ́, lobo kplá Pɔ́lu jó n'i. "
"The governor read the letter and asked what province he was from. Learning that he was from Cilicia, ","Tokpɔngán ɔ́ ka xa wěma ɔ́, bó kan tokpɔn e mɛ nu Pɔ́lu nyí ɔ́ byɔ́. Ée é se ɖɔ Silisíinu wɛ é nyí ɔ́, "
"he said, “I will hear your case when your accusers get here.” Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod's palace.Five days later the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor. ","é ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Mɛ e ɖo hwɛ dó we wɛ lɛ́ɛ ko wá ɔ́, un ná kan nǔ byɔ́ we.” Énɛ́ gúdo ɔ́, é ná gbe ɖɔ è ní sɔ́ ɛ dó axɔ́sú Elódu sín hɔnmɛ, bó cɔ́ ɛ.Azǎn atɔ́ɔ́ngɔ́ ɔ́ gbe ɔ́, vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó Ananíyasi kpódó tomɛxó ɖé lɛ́ɛ kpó, kpódó ɖɛ̌mɛɖenúxótɔ́ e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Tɛtulúsi é kpán wá Sezalée, bó wá jɛ Pɔ́lu sín hwɛ nú tokpɔngán ɔ́. "
"When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented his case before Felix: “We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation. ","Tokpɔngán ɔ́ ka ylɔ́ Pɔ́lu wá, bɔ Tɛtulúsi wlí xó, bó jɛ hwɛ dó Pɔ́lu jí ɖɔ: “Mɛsísí ce Felísi, hwi wɛ nyí mɔ̌, bɔ mǐ mɔ vivo; nǔnywɛ́ e a dǒ ɖo to élɔ́ sín azɔ̌ wa ná wɛ ɔ́ wɛ zɔ́n bɔ nǔ gěgé húzú nú nukɔn yiyi to ɔ́ tɔn.

"Everywhere and in every way, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with profound gratitude. ","Mǐ tunwun nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ nú we hwebǐnu, ɖo fí bǐ, bó ɖo kú tɔn dó nú we wɛ tlala. "
"But in order not to weary you further, I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly. ","Lo ɔ́, un jló ná yí hwenu towe gěgé ǎ, énɛ́ ɔ́ wútu wɛ un ɖo kɛnklɛ́n dó nú we wɛ, ɖɔ a ní nyɔ̌ xomɛ, bó ɖótó xó e ɖɔ nú we gbé un ja ɔ́ ɖo kléwún mɛ. "
"“We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect ","Nya élɔ́ ɔ́, mǐ mɔ ɖɔ azɔn nyanya ɖé wɛ é nyí; é nɔ́ dó avaja Jwifu e ɖo gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ mɛ; sinsɛngbɛ́ Nazalɛ́tinu lɛ́ɛ tɔn sín gǎn wɛ. "
and even tried to desecrate the temple,Fon
By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him.” ,"bó ɖɔ mɛ e ɖo hwɛ dó e wɛ lɛ́ɛ ní wá jɛ hwɛ nú we.] Hwi ɖésúnɔ kó kan nǔ byɔ́ ɛ ɔ́, a nǎ mɔ ɖɔ nǔ e mǐ ɖɔ dó wǔ tɔn ɔ́ bǐ wɛ nyí nǔgbó.” "
"The Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true. ","Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ka nɔ xó e Tɛtulúsi ɖɔ ɔ́ jí, bó ɖɔ nǔ nyí mɔ̌ nǔgbó. "
"When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: “I know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation; so I gladly make my defense. ","Tokpɔngán ɔ́ ka jó xó nú Pɔ́lu, bɔ é wlí xó bo ɖɔ: “Un tunwun ɖɔ a ɖo gǎn ɖu wɛ ɖo to élɔ́ nu din ɔ́, xwe tɔn ko sɛ yi; énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ un ɖeji, bó ná gblɔ́n xó nú mɛ e ɖo hwɛ dó mì wɛ lɛ́ɛ. "
You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship. ,"Un yi Aklúnɔ sɛn gbé ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu din ɔ́, é sɔ́ hú azǎn wěwe ǎ; hwi ɖésúnɔ hɛn ɔ́, a nǎ ba do ná. "
"My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city. ","È mɔ mì bɔ un ɖo nǔ dɔn xá mɛ ɖěbǔ wɛ ɖo sinsɛnxɔ mɛ ǎ, è ka mɔ mì bɔ un fɔ́n hun dó jǐ nú togun ɔ́ ɖo kplɔ́ngbasá lɛ́ɛ, abǐ fí ɖěvo ɖo toxo ɔ́ mɛ ǎ. "
And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me. ,"Nǔ e sín hwɛ dó mì wɛ yě ka ɖe din ɔ́, yě sixú ɖɔ xó ɖé, bó ná ɖe xlɛ́ we ɖɔ nǔgbó wɛ ǎ. "
"However, I admit that I worship the God of our fathers as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that agrees with the Law and that is written in the Prophets, ","Amɔ̌, un yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ jí Mawu e tɔ́gbó mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ nɔ sɛn ɔ́ sɛn wɛ un ɖe gbɔn ali yɔ̌yɔ́ e yě ɖɔ é kún sɔgbe ó é jí; lo ɔ́, nǔ e è wlán dó sɛ́nwéma ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ kpódó nǔ e gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ lɛ́ɛ kpán ɔ́, un ɖi nǔ nú bǐ sésé. "
"and I have the same hope in God as these men, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked. ","Un ka ɖo nukún ɖó Mawu wɛ, lě e yě lɔmɔ̌ ɖo nukún ɖó e wɛ gbɔn é. Mawu ná wá fɔ́n mɛ ɖagbe lɛ́ɛ, kpódó mɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ kpó sín kú. "
So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ un nɔ dó gǎn, bónú ayi ce ma xo hun xá mì ɖo nǔ ɖěbǔ mɛ, ɖo Mawu kpódó gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpán nukɔn ó. "
"“After an absence of several years, I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings. ","“Hwenu e un yi xɔ xwe mɔ̌kpán ɖo gbějí, bó lɛ́ kɔ wá Jeluzalɛ́mu ɔ́, un hɛn akwɛ́ bó ná dó dó alɔ mɛ ce lɛ́ɛ, bó ná lɛ́ xwlé vɔ̌sánú Mawu. "
"I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this. There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance. ","Nǔ énɛ́ ɔ́ kɔn wɛ un ɖe ɖo sinsɛnxɔ mɛ, bɔ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ wá mɔ mì; un ko slá wǔ nɛ́; ahwan ɖé ɖo fínɛ́ ǎ; zǐngídi ɖé ka tíin ǎ, "
"But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me. ","lo ɔ́, ényí Jwifu Azíi tɔn lɛ́ɛ ko mɔ nǔɖé ná ɖɔ dó wú ce wɛ ɔ́, yě wɛ ná kó wá gɔ̌n towe, bó jɛ hwɛ ce nú we. "
Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin– ,"Abǐ, mɛ e ɖo fí din lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, yědɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ní bo ɖɔ nǔ nyanya e un dó sin bɔ yě mɔ bo ɖɔ hwenu e un ɖo toxóɖɔgbɛ́ ɔ́ nukɔn é. "
unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence: ‘It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’ ” ,"Xó ɖokpó e un nɔ te ɖo nukɔn yětɔn, bó ɖɔ bɔ yě hɛn ɔ́, yě ná ɖɔ ɔ́ ɖíe: ‘Un ɖi nǔ ɖɔ mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ ná fɔ́n wú wɛ è ɖo hwɛ dó mì wɛ ɖo nukɔn mitɔn égbé.’ ” "
"Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. “When Lysias the commander comes,” he said, “I will decide your case.” ","Felísi ɔ́ ka mɔ nǔ jɛ Aklúnɔ sín ali ɔ́ wú ganjí.

He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs. ,"É ka ɖɔ nú sɔ́jagán ɔ́ ɖɔ é ní cɔ́ Pɔ́lu bó ka ná ɛ vivo, bó ná gbe xɔ́ntɔn tɔn lɛ́ɛ, nú yě ní nɔ wá gɔ́ alɔ n'i. "
"Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus. ","Azǎn ɖé jɛ ǎ, bɔ Felísi wá, é kpódó asi tɔn Dlusíla e nyí Jwifu ɔ́ kpán. É zɔ́n, bɔ è ylɔ́ Pɔ́lu wá, bɔ é ɖótó xó e Pɔ́lu ɖɔ dó nǔɖiɖi ɖó nú Jezu Klísu wú é. "
"As Paul discoursed on righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, “That's enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you.” ","Lo ɔ́, ée Pɔ́lu ɖo xó ɖɔ dó lě e è nǎ zán gbɛ ɖagbe gbɔn é wú wɛ, bó ɖo xó ɖɔ dó lě e è nǎ ɖu ɖo mɛ ɖésúnɔ jí gbɔn é wú wɛ, bó lɛ́ ɖo xó ɖɔ dó lě e Mawu na wá ɖɔ hwɛ xá gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ gbɔn ɔ́ wú wɛ ɔ́, xɛsi jɛ Felísi jí, bɔ é ɖɔ nú Pɔ́lu ɖɔ: “To yi hwɛ̌; un ko wá mɔ vivo ɔ́, un ná lɛ́ ylɔ́ we.” "
"At the same time he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent for him frequently and talked with him. ","É ɖo akwɛ́ lɔmɔ̌ ɖó nukún wɛ ɖo Pɔ́lu sí; énɛ́ wútu wɛ é nɔ zɔ́n, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ wá n'i hwɛhwɛ, bɔ yě nɔ ɖɔ xó. "
"When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but because Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews, he left Paul in prison.Three days after arriving in the province, Festus went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem, ","Xwe we gúdo ɔ́, Pɔsiwusi Fɛsitúsi wá ɖyɔ́ Felísi.

where the chief priests and Jewish leaders appeared before him and presented the charges against Paul. ,"Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán ɔ́, kpódó Jwifugán lɛ́ɛ kpán ka kplé bo yi jɛ Pɔ́lu sín hwɛ̌ nú Fɛsitúsi, "
"They urgently requested Festus, as a favor to them, to have Paul transferred to Jerusalem, for they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way. ","bó byɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ é ní nyɔ́ xomɛ dó émí wú, bó sɛ́ Pɔ́lu dó Jeluzalɛ́mu. Yě ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɖó yě ko blá gbě tɔn, bó jló ná hu i ɖo alixo. "
"Festus answered, “Paul is being held at Caesarea, and I myself am going there soon. ","Lo ɔ́, Fɛsitúsi yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ Pɔ́lu ɖo gankpá mɛ ɖo Sezalée, émí ɖésúnɔ ka ná yi dɔ̌n ɖo malín málín mɛ. "
"Let some of your leaders come with me and press charges against the man there, if he has done anything wrong.” ","É ka lɛ́ ɖɔ: “Ényí nya énɛ́ wa nǔɖé nyi do hǔn, gǎn mitɔn lɛ́ɛ ní bó xwedó mì yi Sezalée, bó ná yi dó hwɛ ɛ.” "
"After spending eight or ten days with them, he went down to Caesarea, and the next day he convened the court and ordered that Paul be brought before him. ","Azǎn tántɔn, abǐ azǎn wǒ jɛ́n Fɛsitúsi nɔ yě gɔ̌n xɔ, bó lɛ́ kɔ yi Sezalée. Ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn ɔ́, é wá jínjɔ́n hwɛɖɔxɔsá, bó ɖɔ è nǐ kplá Pɔ́lu wá. "
"When Paul appeared, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious charges against him, which they could not prove. ","Ée Pɔ́lu ka wá ɔ́, Jwifu e gosín Jeluzalɛ́mu bó wá lɛ́ɛ lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó e, bó jɛ hwɛ ɖaxó ɖaxó gěgé lɛ́n dó kɔ n'i jí; lo ɔ́, yě sixú ɖe xlɛ́ ɖɔ nǔgbó wɛ ǎ. "
Then Paul made his defense: “I have done nothing wrong against the law of the Jews or against the temple or against Caesar.” ,Pɔ́lu ka jɛ xó ɖɔ dó ba hwɛjijɔ nú éɖée jí ɖɔ: “Un jɛ agɔ ɖé dó Jwifu lɛ́ɛ sín sɛ́n wú ǎ
"Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me there on these charges?” ","Ée Fɛsitúsi ká jló ná wa nǔ bó ná dó xomɛhunhun nú Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, é kanbyɔ́ Pɔ́lu ɖɔ: “A jló ná yi Jeluzalɛ́mu, nú è nǎ yi ɖɔ hwɛ xá we ɖo nukún ce mɛ a?” "
"Paul answered: “I am now standing before Caesar's court, where I ought to be tried. I have not done any wrong to the Jews, as you yourself know very well. ",Pɔ́lu ka yí gbe ɖɔ: “Hwɛɖɔxɔsá ɖaxó wɛ un ná yi ɖo Dadá Hlɔ̌ma tɔn nukɔn
"If, however, I am guilty of doing anything deserving death, I do not refuse to die. But if the charges brought against me by these Jews are not true, no one has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!” ","Ényí un wa nǔɖé nyi do nǔgbó, bɔ nǔ énɛ́ ɔ́ byɔ́ ɖɔ è nǐ hu mì ɔ́, un gbɛ́ kú ǎ.

"After Festus had conferred with his council, he declared: “You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you will go!” ","Fɛsitúsi kpódó toxóɖɔtɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpán ka wá yi kpá, bɔ é wá ɖɔ nú Pɔ́lu ɖɔ: “A ylɔ́ hwɛ ɖaxó ɖo Dadá Hlɔ̌ma tɔn gɔ́n. Hǔn a nǎ yi Dadá Hlɔ̌ma tɔn ɔ́ gɔ́n.” "
A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus. ,"Ée azǎn ɖé jɛ wa yi ɔ́, axɔ́sú Aglipa kpódó asi tɔn Belenísi kpán wá Sezalée, bó ná ɖɔ nǔ dó Fɛsitúsi. "
"Since they were spending many days there, Festus discussed Paul's case with the king. He said: “There is a man here whom Felix left as a prisoner. ","Ée yě ɖo to ɔ́ mɛ fínɛ́ xɔ azǎn gěgé ɔ́, Fɛsitúsi wá ɖó Pɔ́lu sín xó ɔ́ te nú axɔ́sú ɔ́; é ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Nya ɖé ɖo fí, bɔ tokpɔngán Felísi jó e nyi gankpá mɛ. "
"When I went to Jerusalem, the chief priests and elders of the Jews brought charges against him and asked that he be condemned. ","Hwenu e un yi Jeluzalɛ́mu ɔ́, vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ kpódó Jwifu tomɛxó lɛ́ɛ kpán wá jɛ hwɛ tɔn nú mì, bó byɔ́ ɖɔ ma ɖó hwɛ n'i. "
“I told them that it is not the Roman custom to hand over any man before he has faced his accusers and has had an opportunity to defend himself against their charges. ,"Un ka yí gbe nú yě ɖɔ cóbónú Hlɔ̌manu lɛ́ɛ ná jó mɛɖé ɔ́, mɛ e ɖo hwɛ dó e wɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖó ná jɛ hwɛ tɔn ɖo mɛ ɔ́ ɖésúnɔ nukɔn, bónú é ná mɔ tɛn, bó ɖɔ xó dó ba hwɛjijɔ nú éɖée hwɛ̌. "
"When they came here with me, I did not delay the case, but convened the court the next day and ordered the man to be brought in. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, yě xwedó mì wá fí; un sɔ́ nɔ te ǎ; ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn jɛ́n un yi jínjɔ́n hwɛɖɔzinkpo ce jí, bó ɖɔ è ní kplá nya ɔ́ hɛn wá. "
"When his accusers got up to speak, they did not charge him with any of the crimes I had expected. ","Yě mɛ e ɖo hwɛ dó e wɛ lɛ́ɛ sí te, bó dó hwɛ ɛ; lo ɔ́, nǔ nyanya e un vɛdó ɖɔ yě na ɖɔ é dó sin lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, yě ɖɔ ɖěbǔ ǎ. "
"Instead, they had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a dead man named Jesus who Paul claimed was alive. ","Nǔɖé dɔn xá ɛ wɛ jɛ́n yě ɖe kpowun; yě ɖo nǔ dɔn xá ɛ wɛ dó sinsɛn yě ɖésúnɔ tɔn wú, bó ɖo nǔ dɔn xá ɛ wɛ dó nya e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Jezu ɔ́ wú. Nya énɛ́ ko kú; Pɔ́lu ka ɖɔ é ɖo gbɛ. "
I was at a loss how to investigate such matters,Fon
"When Paul made his appeal to be held over for the Emperor's decision, I ordered him held until I could send him to Caesar.” ","lo ɔ́, Pɔ́lu ylɔ́ hwɛ ɖaxó: é byɔ́ ɖɔ è ní bo ɖo émí cɔ́ wɛ káká jɛ hwenu e Dadá ɔ́ ná ɖe gbeta ɖé tɔ́n dó xó émítɔn wú é; énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, un ná gbe ɖɔ è ní cɔ́ ɛ káká yi jɛ hwenu e un ná sɛ́ ɛ dó Dadá ɔ́ gɔ́n é.” "
"Then Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to hear this man myself.” He replied, “Tomorrow you will hear him.” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, Aglipa ɖɔ nú Fɛsitúsi ɖɔ: “Nyɛ ɖésúnɔ ɔ́, un jló ná se xó ɖé ɖo nya énɛ́ nu.” Fɛsitúsi ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Sɔ ko su ɔ́, a na se xó tɔn.” "
"The next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience room with the high ranking officers and the leading men of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in. ","Ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn ɔ́, Aglipa kpódó asi tɔn Belenísi kpán wá, bɔ ahwangán lɛ́ɛ kpódó tonukún lɛ́ɛ kpán kplá yě wa yi, bɔ yě byɔ́ hwɛɖɔxɔ ɔ́ sá kpódó yɛ̌yi kpán. Fɛsitúsi ná gbe bɔ è kplá Pɔ́lu wá. "
"Festus said: “King Agrippa, and all who are present with us, you see this man! The whole Jewish community has petitioned me about him in Jerusalem and here in Caesarea, shouting that he ought not to live any longer. ","Fɛsitúsi ɖɔ: “Axɔ́sú Aglipa kpódó mi mɛ e ɖo fí lɛ́ɛ é bǐ kpán; nya e sín hwɛ wɛ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ bǐ jɛ nú mì ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu, bó ka lɛ́ wá jɛ nú mì ɖo fí, bó sú xó syɛ́nsyɛ́n ɖɔ è ma ɖó e gbɛ ó ɔ́, nya ɔ́ ɖíe. "
"I found he had done nothing deserving of death, but because he made his appeal to the Emperor I decided to send him to Rome. ","Nyɛ ka mɔ ɖɔ é kún wa nǔɖé nyi do bónú è nǎ hu i ó. Lo ɔ́, ée é ɖésúnɔ ko ylɔ́ hwɛ ɖaxó ɖo Dadá Hlɔ̌ma tɔn gɔ́n ɔ́, énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ un ɖe gbeta tɔ́n ɖɔ un ná sɛ́ ɛ dó gɔ̌n tɔn. "
"But I have nothing definite to write to His Majesty about him. Therefore I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that as a result of this investigation I may have something to write. ","Un ɖó nǔɖé tawun bó ná wlán dó wǔ tɔn sɛ́ dó Dadá ɔ́ ǎ. Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ un ylɔ́ ɛ wá nukɔn mitɔn, ɖo tají ɔ́, hwi axɔ́sú Aglipa nukɔn, bónú è ko kan nǔ byɔ́ ɛ ɔ́, ma mɔ nǔɖé wlán sɛ́ dó. "
"For I think it is unreasonable to send on a prisoner without specifying the charges against him.”Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for yourself.” So Paul motioned with his hand and began his defense: ","Đó nyɛ mɔ ɖɔ è sɛ́ gantɔ́ ɖé dó mɛ, bó ma ka ɖɔ nǔ e é wa ɔ́ dó jǐ tɔn ǎ ɔ́, é kún sɔgbe ó.”Aglipa ka ɖɔ nú Pɔ́lu ɖɔ: “A ɖó xó ɖé ná ɖɔ, bó ná dó ba hwɛjijɔ nú hwiɖée hǔn, bó ɖɔ; un ná gbe tɔn we.” Pɔ́lu ka dlɛ́n alɔ, bó wlí xó, bó ɖɔ: "
"“King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to stand before you today as I make my defense against all the accusations of the Jews, ","“Axɔ́sú Aglipa, é víví nú mì tlala, bɔ nǔ e sín hwɛ dó mì wɛ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ɖe ɔ́, má sixú ɖɔ xó dó ba hwɛjijɔ nú nyɛɖée ɖo nukɔn towe égbé; "
"and especially so because you are well acquainted with all the Jewish customs and controversies. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently. ","ɖó a mɔ nǔ jɛ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ sín hwɛndo wú ganjí, bó tunwun nǔ e yě nɔ dɔn xá yěɖée lɛ́ɛ. Énɛ́ wú ɔ́, kɛnklɛ́n ɖǒ suúlu, bó ɖótó mì. "
"“The Jews all know the way I have lived ever since I was a child, from the beginning of my life in my own country, and also in Jerusalem. ","“Lě e un zán gbɛ ce gbɔn sín wǐnnyáwínnyá mɛ ce, lě e un nɔ togun ce tɛ́ntin gbɔn sín hwenu e è ji mì ɔ́, lě e un nɔ Jeluzalɛ́mu gbɔn é ɖésú ɔ́, Jwifu lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ tunwun. "
"They have known me for a long time and can testify, if they are willing, that according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived as a Pharisee. ","Yě tunwun mì din ɔ́, é ko lín, bɔ ényí yě jló wɛ ɔ́, yě ná ɖe kúnnu nú mì ɖɔ un nyí gbɛ̌ví sinsɛngbɛ́ e syɛ́n hú ɖě lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɔ́ tɔn. Sinsɛngbɛ́ énɛ́ ɔ́ wɛ nyí Falizyɛn lɛ́ɛ tɔn. "
And now it is because of my hope in what God has promised our fathers that I am on trial today. ,"Akpá e Mawu dó nú tɔ́gbó mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ, bɔ un ɖo nukún ɖó wɛ ɔ́, é wútu wɛ è ɖo hwɛ ɖɔ xá mì wɛ din. "
"This is the promise our twelve tribes are hoping to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve God day and night. O king, it is because of this hope that the Jews are accusing me. ","Akɔta mǐtɔn wěwe lɛ́ɛ lɔ ɖo nukún ɖó akpá énɛ́ sín ɖiɖe wɛ, bó nɔ́ ván kan bó nɔ́ sɛn Mawu kpódó lǐnsyɛ́nsyɛ́n kpán zǎn kéze. Axɔ́sú e! Nukúnɖíɖó énɛ́ wɛ zɔ́n bɔ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ɖo hwɛ dó mì wɛ. "
Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead? ,Étɛ́wú mi ka nɔ lin ɖɔ è kún sixú ɖi ɖɔ Mawu ná fɔ́n mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ ó? 
“I too was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth. ,"“Nyɛ ɖésúnɔ ɔ́, un ko lin ɖɔ un ná bló nǔ e ɖo gbɛ ɔ́ bǐ, dó tɔ́n ahwan Jezu Nazalɛ́tinu ɔ́ sín nyǐkɔ. "
"And that is just what I did in Jerusalem. On the authority of the chief priests I put many of the saints in prison, and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them. ","Nǔ e un wa ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu ɔ́ nɛ́. Un yí acɛ ɖo vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ sí, bó nɔ wlí mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ gěgé dó gan, bɔ hwenu e è nɔ ɖo yě hu wɛ ɔ́, un nɔ yí gbe ná. "
"Many a time I went from one synagogue to another to have them punished, and I tried to force them to blaspheme. In my obsession against them, I even went to foreign cities to persecute them. ","Hwɛhwɛ wɛ un nɔ dɔn tó nú yě gbɔn kplɔ́ngbasá Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn bǐ; un nɔ zín yě jí ɖɔ yě ní nylá nu dó Mawu wú; xomɛ yětɔn nɔ sin mì ɖaxó, bɔ un nɔ hun káká yi to ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ mɛ, bó nɔ yi dó ya nú yě. "
“On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests. ,"“Azɔ̌ énɛ́ wa gbé wɛ un xwe ɖo Damási, bɔ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán lɛ́ɛ ná gbe mì, bó ná acɛ mì bɔ un ɖidó. "
"About noon, O king, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, blazing around me and my companions. ","Axɔ́sú e!

"We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, ‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.’ ","bɔ mǐ jɛ ayǐ.

"“Then I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ “ ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,’ the Lord replied. ",Un ka kanbyɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ: ‘Hwi mɛ ka wɛ?’ Aklúnɔ ɔ́ ka yí gbe nú mì ɖɔ: ‘Nyɛ Jezu e dó ya ná wɛ a ɖe é wɛ. 
‘Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen of me and what I will show you. ,"Lo ɔ́, sí te, bó nɔ te; nǔ e wú un ka tɔ́n dó jǐ towe ɔ́ ɖíe: un ná sɔ́ we dó bló mɛsɛntɔ́ ce ná; a nǎ nyí kúnnuɖetɔ́ ce, bɔ nǔ e a mɔ din lɛ́ɛ kpódó ɖěe un ná lɛ́ wá sɔ́ xlɛ́ we lɛ́ɛ kpán ɔ́, a nǎ ɖɔ nú mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ.

I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them ,"Un ná hwlɛ́n we gán ɖo togun Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn e mɛ un ná sɛ́ we dó ɔ́ sí, bó ná lɛ́ hwlɛ́n we gán ɖo mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ, bɔ un ná sɛ́ we dó yě mɛ lɛ́ɛ sí. "
"to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’ ","Un sɛ́ we dó, bónú a nǎ hun nukún nú yě; bónú a nǎ kplá yě sín zǐnflú mɛ wá wěziza nu; bó ná ɖe yě sín Satáan sín acɛ mɛ wá Mawu gɔ́n, lobo nú yě ɖi nǔ nú mì ɔ́, Mawu ná sɔ́ hwɛ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ kɛ yě, bɔ yě ná mɔ tɛnmɛ ɖo mɛ e nyí étɔn lɛ́ɛ tɛ́ntin.’ "
"“So then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the vision from heaven. ","“Axɔ́sú Aglipa e! Ée nǔ nyí mɔ̌ ɔ́, un vɛ́ tóli nú nǔ e Mawu sɔ́ xlɛ́ mì lɛ́ɛ ǎ. "
"First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and to the Gentiles also, I preached that they should repent and turn to God and prove their repentance by their deeds. ","Lo ɔ́, un to yi ɖɔ Mawuxó ɔ́ nú Damásinu lɛ́ɛ kpódó Jeluzalɛ́munu lɛ́ɛ kpó hwɛ̌, bó lɛ́ wá yi ɖɔ nú mɛ e ɖo Judée gbé jí lɛ́ɛ bǐ, kpódó mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ kpán, bó ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ yě ní lɛ́ kɔ sín hwɛ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ gúdo; yě ní wá Mawu gɔ́n; yě ní nɔ wa nǔ e ná ɖe xlɛ́ ɖɔ yě lɛ́ kɔ sín hwɛ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ gúdo nǔgbó é. "
That is why the Jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ wlí mì ɖo sinsɛnxɔ mɛ, bó jló ná hu mì. "
"But I have had God's help to this very day, and so I stand here and testify to small and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen– ","Mawu ka wa nǔ, bɔ un kpo ɖo afɔte káká jɛ égbé; un nɔ ɖo Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ sín kúnnu ɖe wɛ ɖo gbɛtɔ́ kpaa lɛ́ɛ kpódó gbɛtɔ́ nukúnɖéjí lɛ́ɛ kpán nukɔn; un ka nɔ ɖɔ nǔɖé zɛ nǔ e gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpódó Mɔyízi kpán ko ɖɔ é ná jɛ é wú ǎ; "
"that the Christ would suffer and, as the first to rise from the dead, would proclaim light to his own people and to the Gentiles.” ","é wɛ nyí ɖɔ: Klísu ná kú; é wɛ ka nyí mɛ nukɔn nukɔntɔn e ná fɔ́n sín kú ɔ́, bó ná jlá wěziza hwlɛngán tɔn ɔ́ mǐ mɛ Jwifu lɛ́ɛ kpódó mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ kpán.” "
"At this point Festus interrupted Paul's defense. “You are out of your mind, Paul!” he shouted. “Your great learning is driving you insane.” ","Ée Pɔ́lu ɖo xó ɖɔ dó ba hwɛjijɔ nú éɖée wɛ mɔ̌ ɔ́, Fɛsitúsi sú xó, bó ɖɔ: “Pɔ́lu! A hun taɖu wɛ a? A kplɔ́n wěma káká bɔ é dó taɖu we!” "

"The king is familiar with these things, and I can speak freely to him. I am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice, because it was not done in a corner. ","Axɔ́sú Aglipa mɔ do nú nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ; hǔn un hɛn ɔ́, un ná ɖɔ xó kpódó jiɖiɖe kpó ɖo nukɔn tɔn; ɖó un ɖó gǎnjɛwú ɖɔ é tunwun nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó, ɖó nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖě jɛ ɖo nǔglɔ́ fí ɖé ǎ. "

"We boarded a ship from Adramyttium about to sail for ports along the coast of the province of Asia, and we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us. ","Mǐ dǒ Adlamitiwɔmu sín tɔjíhún ɖé, bɔ é ko ɖo nǎ sún wɛ, lobo ná gbɔn tɔjíhúnglíntɛn Azíi tɔn dín. Alisitáki e gosín Tɛsaloniki ɖo Masedwani kanmɛ ɔ́ dó tɔjíhún ɔ́ xá mǐ. "
"The next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, in kindness to Paul, allowed him to go to his friends so they might provide for his needs. ","Ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn ɔ́, mǐ jɛ Sidɔ́ɔn; Juliwusi ka nyɔ́ xomɛ dó Pɔ́lu wú, bó ná ɛ gbe ɖɔ ní yi kpɔ́n xɔ́ntɔn tɔn lɛ́ɛ, bónú yě gɔ̌ alɔ n'i ɖo nǔ e hudó e lɛ́ɛ mɛ. "
From there we put out to sea again and passed to the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us. ,"Ée mǐ gosín fínɛ́ ɔ́, hǔn ɔ́ jɛ jɔhɔn kpé jí, bɔ mǐ gbɔn kɛ́nkɛ́n nú tɔtɛ́ntinto Cíplu tɔn ɔ́ bó ɖidó. "
"When we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia. ","Ée mǐ ka xo xu e ɖo Silisíi kpódó Panfilíi kpán kpá ɔ́ zlɛ́ ɔ́, mǐ wá yi jɛ to e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Míilu ɔ́ mɛ, ɖo Lisíi yíkúngban jí. "
There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board. ,"Sɔ́ja kanwekogán ɔ́ mɔ tɔjíhún Alɛsándli tɔn ɖé ɖo fínɛ́, bɔ é xwe Italíi, bɔ sɔ́ja kanwekogán ɔ́ kplá mǐ d'é mɛ. "
"We made slow headway for many days and had difficulty arriving off Cnidus. When the wind did not allow us to hold our course, we sailed to the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone. ","Mǐ zɔn dɛ̌dɛ̌ xɔ azǎn; é bɔwǔ có mǐ wá jɛ Kinidi sín hǎ jí ǎ; jɔhɔn ka lɔn nú mǐ ná glín hǔn ɖó fínɛ́ ǎ, bɔ mǐ gbɔn kɛ́nkɛ́n nú Klɛ́ti, ɖo Salumɔnɛ́ɛ sín alɔxwé. "
"We moved along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea. ","Mǐ jɛ tagba ɖésú dó kun tɔjíhún ɔ́ gbɔn xutó xutó wá jɛ fí ɖé, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ fí ɔ́ ɖɔ Tɔjíhúnglintɛn ɖagbe, bɔ é ɖo to e nyí Lazayia ɔ́ kpá. "
"Much time had been lost, and sailing had already become dangerous because by now it was after the Fast. So Paul warned them, ","Mǐ gǔ hwenu ɖo xu jí, bɔ tɔ jí gbingbɔn hwenɛ́nu ka bló awǒvinú ɖaxó ɖé, ɖó nubláblá hwenu ko dín wa yi; énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ Pɔ́lu ɖɔ nú yě ɖ'ayǐ ɖɔ: "
"“Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo, and to our own lives also.” ","“Xɔ́ntɔn ce lɛ́ɛ mi, nyɛ mɔ ɖɔ mǐ jɛ tɔ jí hwe élɔ́ nu din ɔ́, mǐ ná yi kpé afɔkú ɖaxó, bɔ agban lɛ́ɛ kpódó hǔn ɔ́ kpán kɛ́ɖɛ́ wɛ ná dɔn ǎ, lo ɔ́, mǐ ɖésúnɔ sín gbɛ ɖo axɔ́ nu.” "
"But the centurion, instead of listening to what Paul said, followed the advice of the pilot and of the owner of the ship. ",Sɔ́ja kanwekogán ɔ́ ka ɖeji dó xó e ɖɔ wɛ hǔnkuntɔ́ ɔ́ kpódó hǔnnɔ ɔ́ kpán ɖe é wú hú xó e ɖɔ wɛ Pɔ́lu ɖe lɛ́ɛ. 
"Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided that we should sail on, hoping to reach Phoenix and winter there. This was a harbor in Crete, facing both southwest and northwest. ","Tɔjíhúnglíntɛn énɛ́ nyɔ́ nɔ avivɔ hwenu ǎ; énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ mɛ hǎbǔ gbɔ bó yí gbe ɖɔ émí ná ɖidó, bó ná tɛ́nkpɔ́n bónú yě kpé wú ɔ́, yě ná yi Fenísi e nyí tɔjíhúnglíntɛn Klɛ́ti tɔn ɔ́, bó nɔ fínɛ́ avivɔ hwenu; ɖó to énɛ́ kpan nukɔn tofɔligbé-gbadahwe jí, kpódó totaligbé-gbadahwe jí kpó. "
"When a gentle south wind began to blow, they thought they had obtained what they wanted; so they weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of Crete. ","Jɔhɔn flɛ́flɛ́ ɖé jɛ nyinyi jí sín tofɔligbé, bɔ yě vɛdó ɖɔ émí ná sixú yi lě e émí lin gbɔn ɔ́ wɛ sín; yě ɖe gandótɔnu lɛ́ɛ síin, bó sún hǔn, bó jɛ xutó xutó gbɔn jí, ɖo tɔtɛ́ntinto Klɛ́ti tɔn kpá. "
"Before very long, a wind of hurricane force, called the “northeaster,” swept down from the island. ","Zaanɖé ɔ́, jɔhɔn ɖaxó ɖé jɛ nyinyi jí, sín tɔtɛ́ntinto ɔ́ sín só lɛ́ɛ jí, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ jɔhɔn ɔ́ ɖɔ “Totaligbé-zǎnzǎnhwe jí.” "
The ship was caught by the storm and could not head into the wind,Fon
"As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were hardly able to make the lifeboat secure. ","Mǐ wá gbɔn tɔtɛ́ntinto kpɛví ɖé kpá, bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ to ɔ́ ɖɔ Kodáa. Mǐ jɛ tagba ɖésú, cóbó wá kpé akló ɔ́ wú. "
"When the men had hoisted it aboard, they passed ropes under the ship itself to hold it together. Fearing that they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be driven along. ","Yě zé akló ɔ́ dó tɔjíhún ɔ́ mɛ, bó sin kan lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó tɔjíhún ɔ́; yě ka ɖo xɛsi ɖi wɛ ɖɔ hǔn ɔ́ ní ma yi gba dó nyɛ̌kɛ́n wú ɖo Libíi xuta ó, bó ɖe gandótɔnu e nɔ gbɔn sin nukún mɛ ɔ́, bó jó yěɖée dó mɔ̌, bɔ jɔhɔn ɔ́ dɔn yě ɖidó. "
We took such a violent battering from the storm that the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard. ,"Jɔhɔn ɖaxó ɔ́ kpo ɖo mǐ dán wɛ baɖabaɖa, bɔ ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn ɔ́, yě jɛ agban lɛ́ɛ bɛ́ kɔn nyi xu mɛ jí. "
"On the third day, they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands. ","Azǎn atɔngɔ́ ɔ́ gbe ɔ́, yě sɔ́ alɔ yě ɖésúnɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ dó ɖe nǔ kpinkpɛn e ɖo hǔn ɔ́ wú lɛ́ɛ kɔn nyi xu mɛ. "
"When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging, we finally gave up all hope of being saved. ","Ée mǐ ma sɔ́ mɔ hwesivɔ́ kpódó sunví lɛ́ɛ kpán sín azǎn mɔ̌kpán ɖíe ǎ, bɔ jɔhɔn ɖaxó ɔ́ ka kpo ɖo nyinyi wɛ syɛ́nsyɛ́n jɛ́n wɛ ɔ́, mǐ sɔ́ ɖó nukún ɖěbǔ ɖɔ mǐ ná gán ǎ. "
"After the men had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up before them and said: “Men, you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete; then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss. ","Mǐ ma sɔ́ ɖu nǔ ǎ ɔ́, é kó lín.

"But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be lost; only the ship will be destroyed. ","Amɔ̌, din ɔ́, mi ɖó akɔ́nkpinkpan, mɛ ɖěbǔ ná kú ɖo mǐ mɛ ǎ; hǔn ɔ́ kɛ́ɖɛ́ jɛ́n ná lá mɛ. "
Last night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood beside me ,"Đó Mawu e tɔn un nyí, bó nɔ́ sɛn ɔ́ sín wɛnsagun ɖokpó sɛ yá mì égbé zǎn mɛ, "
"and said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar; and God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.’ ","bó ɖɔ nú mì ɖɔ: ‘Pɔ́lu, ma ɖi xɛsi ó, ɖó a nǎ yi Dadá Hlɔ̌ma tɔn nukɔn dandan, bɔ hwi wútu ɔ́, Mawu ná ná gbɛ mɛ e ɖo tɔ jí xá we lɛ́ɛ bǐ.’ "
"So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me. ","Énɛ́ wú ɔ́, mɛ ce lɛ́ɛ mi, mi bo kpán akɔ́n, ɖó un ɖeji dó Mawu wú ɖɔ nǔ e é ɖɔ nú mì ɔ́ jɛ́n wɛ ná jɛ. "
"Nevertheless, we must run aground on some island.” ","Lo ɔ́, tɔjíhún mǐtɔn ɖó ná yi gba ɖo tɔtɛ́ntinto ɖé jí.” "
"On the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the Adriatic Sea, when about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land. ","Azǎn wɛ̌nɛgɔ́ ɔ́ gbe zǎn mɛ ɔ́, jɔhɔn ɖaxó ɔ́ kpo ɖo mǐ dɔn wɛ bɔ mǐ yi xu e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Adliatíki é wa jí; ée zǎn vlɔ́ ɖó we mɔ̌ ɔ́, tɔnúwatɔ́ lɛ́ɛ vɛdó ɖɔ mǐ ɖo ayǐkúngban ɖé sɛ yá wɛ sín, "
They took soundings and found that the water was a hundred and twenty feet deep. A short time later they took soundings again and found it was ninety feet deep. ,"bó sin nǔ kpinkpɛn ɖé dó kan nu, bó sɔ́ dó tɔ ɔ́ mɛ kpɔ́n, bó mɔ ɖɔ tɔ ɔ́ sín do yiyi ɖo mɛ̌tlu gbantɔ́n-nukún-we (37).

"Fearing that we would be dashed against the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight. ","Yě ka ɖo xɛsi ɖi wɛ ɖɔ hǔn ɔ́ ma wá yi gba dó só ɖé wú ó; énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ yě dó gandótɔnu ɛnɛ xu ɔ́ mɛ, ɖo hǔn ɔ́ sín gúdo; yě ka ɖo vo sa wɛ ɖɔ ayǐ ní vɛ́ yá wǔ hɔ́n. "
"In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea, pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow. ","Tɔnúwatɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kó jló ná hɔn jó hǔn ɔ́ dó, bó ɖe tɔjíhún ɔ́ nyi xu jí; yě bló nǔ ɖi mɛ e xwe gandótɔnu e ɖo hǔn ɔ́ nukɔn lɛ́ɛ sɔ́ gbé ɖɔhun. "
"Then Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved.” ","Pɔ́lu ka ɖɔ nú sɔ́ja kanwekogán ɔ́ kpódó sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ kpán ɖɔ: “Ényí mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ma nɔ hǔn ɔ́ mɛ ǎ ɔ́, mi ná gán ǎ.” "
So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it fall away. ,"Bɔ sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ sɛ́n kan nú tɔjíhún ɔ́, bó jó dó, bɔ tɔ dɔn ɛ yi. "
"Just before dawn Paul urged them all to eat. “For the last fourteen days,” he said, “you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food–you haven't eaten anything. ","Ée ayǐ ɖibla hɔ́n ɔ́, Pɔ́lu dó kɛnklɛ́n nú yě bǐ ɖɔ yě ní ɖu nǔ; é ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Sín azǎn wɛ̌nɛ ɖíe ɖokpóó wɛ mi ɖo adohu adohu jí, bó gbɛ́ nǔ ɖu. "
Now I urge you to take some food. You need it to survive. Not one of you will lose a single hair from his head.” ,"Énɛ́ wú wɛ un ɖo ɖiɖɔ nú mi wɛ ɖɔ mi ní ɖu nǔ, bó ná nɔ gbɛ, ɖó nǔɖé ná wa ɖa e ɖo ta mitɔn ɔ́ ɖokpó géé ǎ.” "
"After he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat. ","Ée Pɔ́lu ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́, é zé wɔ̌xúxú, bó dó kú nú Mawu ɖo mɛ bǐ nukún mɛ, bó kán, lobo jɛ ɖuɖu jí. "
They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves. ,"Nǔ énɛ́ dó wǔsyɛ́n lanmɛ nú yě bǐ, bɔ yě lɔmɔ̌ ɖu nǔ. "
Altogether there were 276 of us on board. ,Mǐ mɛ e ɖo hǔn ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ bló gbɛtɔ́ afɔɖé kanɖé gbantɔ́n-nukún-ɖokpó (276). 
"When they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea. ","Ée yě ɖu nǔ bó gɔ́ xo ɔ́, yě bɛ́ jinukún e kpo ɖo hǔn ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ kɔn nyi tɔ mɛ, bónú hǔn ɔ́ ná dó fúɖá. "
"When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could. ","Đěe ayǐ hɔ́n ɔ́, tɔnúwatɔ́ lɛ́ɛ sɔ́ tunwun fí e yě ɖe ɔ́ ǎ; lo ɔ́, yě mɔ xugbado ɖé kpódó xuta ɖé kpó sɛ́ dó, bó ɖɔ émí ná dó gǎn, bó ná kpɔ́n ɖɔ émí ná sixú dɔn hǔn ɔ́ yi dɔ̌n a jí. "
"Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach. ","Yě tún kan nú gandótɔnu lɛ́ɛ, bó jó yě dó nyi xu mɛ; azɔn ɖokpó ɔ́, yě tún kan nú zɛn e yě nɔ dó jlɔ́ ali nú hǔn ɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, bó dó avɔ ɖokpó dó nukɔn nú hǔn ɔ́, bɔ jɔhɔn dó alɔ mɛ, bó dɔn yě ɖidó agě. "
"But the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf. ","Hǔn ɔ́ ka wá yi dó ta nyɛ̌kɛ́n mɛ, bó sɔ́ sixú sɛ tɛn ǎ; aslɔkɛ́ lɛ́ɛ sín zǐngídi ká hɛn hǔn ɔ́ gba ɖo gúdo. "
The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away and escaping. ,"Bɔ sɔ́ja lɛ́ɛ ɖó gbe kpɔ́, bó ná hu gantɔ́ e ɖo hǔn ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ, nú yě mɛ ɖě ma lin tɔ bó hɔn yi ó. "
But the centurion wanted to spare Paul's life and kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land. ,"Lo ɔ́, sɔ́ja kanwekogán ɔ́ lɔn nú yě ǎ, ɖó é jló ná hwlɛ́n Pɔ́lu gán. É ná gbe ɖɔ mɛ e nyɔ́ tɔ lin lɛ́ɛ ní jɛ tɔ dó nukɔn, bó lin tɔ yi agě jí. "
"The rest were to get there on planks or on pieces of the ship. In this way everyone reached land in safety.Once safely on shore, we found out that the island was called Malta. ","Mɛ e kpo lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, yědɛɛ lɛ́ɛ na zunfán xwlɛ, abǐ hǔn ɔ́ sín fínfɛ́n lɛ́ɛ, bó ná jɛ yě gúdo jɛ agě jí.

The islanders showed us unusual kindness. They built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold. ,"To ɔ́ mɛ nu lɛ́ɛ nyɔ́ xomɛ dó mǐ wú tlala. Ée jǐ wlí, bɔ avivɔ gbɛ́ ɔ́, yě bɔ myɔ ɖaxó ɖé, bó yí jǒnɔ mǐtɔn ɖ'é kɔn. "
"Paul gathered a pile of brushwood and, as he put it on the fire, a viper, driven out by the heat, fastened itself on his hand. ","Pɔ́lu bɛ́ nǔywɛ́, bó ná kɔn nyi myɔ ɔ́ mɛ, bɔ amanɔnú jakpata ɖokpó tɔ́n sín nǔywɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ, bó tɛ́ dó alɔ tɔn wú, ɖó myɔ ɔ́ sín yǒzo hɛn ɛ. "
"When the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to each other, “This man must be a murderer; for though he escaped from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.” ","Ée to ɔ́ mɛ nu lɛ́ɛ mɔ dan ɔ́ ɖo gblɛlɛ ɖo alɔ tɔn wú ɔ́, yě nɔ ɖɔ nú yěɖée ɖɔ: “Dandan mɛ ɔ́, mɛhutɔ́ wɛ nya élɔ́ nyí; ɖó é gán ɖo xu sí, có vodún hwɛjijɔ kpo ɖo gǔdo tɔn.” "
But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no ill effects. ,Pɔ́lu ka mi dan ɔ́ dó myɔ ɔ́ mɛ
"The people expected him to swell up or suddenly fall dead, but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god. ","Mɛ lɛ́ɛ ko ɖo te kpɔ́n ɖɔ é ná jɛ flɔ́flɔ́ jí, abǐ é ná jɛ ayǐ bó kú cúɖúɖú; lo ɔ́, ée yě nɔ te káká bɔ nǔɖé ma sɔ́ wa ɛ ǎ ɔ́, yě húzú gbe bó ɖɔ vodún wɛ é nyí. "
"There was an estate nearby that belonged to Publius, the chief official of the island. He welcomed us to his home and for three days entertained us hospitably. ","To ɔ́ mɛ sín gǎn e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Publiwúsi ɔ́ ɖó ayǐkúngban ɖokpó ɖo akpá fínɛ́. É yí jǒnɔ mǐtɔn, bɔ é fɛ́ wǔ ɖésú, bɔ mǐ nɔ xwé tɔn gbe xɔ azǎn atɔn. "
"His father was sick in bed, suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and, after prayer, placed his hands on him and healed him. ","Publiwúsi sín tɔ́ ɖo ayǐmlɔ́mlɔ́, bɔ avivɔ ɖo jǐ tɔn, bɔ é ɖo zɛntín nyɛ wɛ. Pɔ́lu ka yi kpɔ́n ɛ, bó xo ɖɛ, bó ɖó alɔ jǐ tɔn, bó gbɔ azɔn n'i. "
"When this had happened, the rest of the sick on the island came and were cured. ","Énɛ́ gúdo ɔ́, azinzɔnnɔ e kpo ɖo to ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ wá mɔ Pɔ́lu, bɔ é gbɔ azɔn nú yě lɔmɔ̌. "
"They honored us in many ways and when we were ready to sail, they furnished us with the supplies we needed. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ yě wlí yɛ̌yi bǐ nú mǐ, bɔ ée mǐ ɖo hǔn mɛ byɔ́ wɛ ɔ́, yě ná nǔ e ná hudó mǐ lɛ́ɛ bǐ mǐ. "
After three months we put out to sea in a ship that had wintered in the island. It was an Alexandrian ship with the figurehead of the twin gods Castor and Pollux. ,"Sun atɔn wɛ mǐ bló ɖo to énɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ, cóbó wá dó hǔn ɖé, bɔ é ko wá nɔ fínɛ́ avivɔ hwenu; Alɛsándli wɛ é gosín, bɔ è ɖǒ nyǐkɔ n'i ɖɔ “Vodún hǒxo lɛ́ɛ.” "
We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days. ,"Mǐ wá jɛ Silakúsi, bó nɔ fínɛ́ xɔ azǎn atɔn. "
"From there we set sail and arrived at Rhegium. The next day the south wind came up, and on the following day we reached Puteoli. ","Ée mǐ wá gosín fínɛ́ ɔ́, hǔn ɔ́ gbɔn xutó xutó káká yi jɛ Hlejio. Ayǐhɔ́ngbe tɔn ɔ́, jɔhɔn tofɔligbé tɔn ɔ́ jɛ nyinyi jí, bɔ azǎn atɔngɔ́ ɔ́ gbe ɔ́, mǐ jɛ Puzɔ́lu. "
There we found some brothers who invited us to spend a week with them. And so we came to Rome. ,"Mǐ mɔ nɔví mǐtɔn ɖo Klísu mɛ e ɖo fínɛ́ lɛ́ɛ, bɔ yě sa vo nú mǐ ɖɔ mǐ ní nɔ émí gɔ́n nú azǎn tɛ́nwe, bɔ mǐ nɔ yě gɔ̌n. Fínɛ́ wɛ mǐ gosín bó yi Hlɔ̌ma. "
"The brothers there had heard that we were coming, and they traveled as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. At the sight of these men Paul thanked God and was encouraged. ","Nɔví mǐtɔn ɖo Klísu mɛ e ɖo Hlɔ̌ma lɛ́ɛ kó se ɖɔ mǐ jǎwe, bó wá kpé mǐ ɖo alixo; mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ wá nɔ te kpɔ́n mǐ ɖo Jǒnɔyítɛn Atɔn lɛ́ɛ nukɔn; mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ hun káká wá kpé mǐ ɖo Apiwúsixi mɛ.

"When we got to Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, with a soldier to guard him. ","Ée mǐ jɛ Hlɔ̌ma ɔ́, è nǎ gbe Pɔ́lu ɖɔ ní yi nɔ vo; è ka ɖó sɔ́ja ɖokpó n'i, bɔ é ná nɔ cɔ́ ɛ. "
"Three days later he called together the leaders of the Jews. When they had assembled, Paul said to them: “My brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or against the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans. ","Azǎn atɔngɔ́ ɔ́ gbe ɔ́, Pɔ́lu ylɔ́ Jwifu nukúnɖéjí lɛ́ɛ wá xwé tɔn gbe.

"They examined me and wanted to release me, because I was not guilty of any crime deserving death. ","Ée Hlɔ̌manu lɛ́ɛ kan nǔ byɔ́ mì káká ɔ́, yě mɔ nǔɖé wú ná ɖó dó, bó dó ɖó kúhwɛ nú mì ǎ, bó kó jló ná jó mì. "
"But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar–not that I had any charge to bring against my own people. ","Lo ɔ́, Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ka gbɛ́; énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, un mɔ ɖɔ é ɖo dandan mɛ nú ma ylɔ́ hwɛ ɖaxó ɖo Dadá Hlɔ̌ma tɔn gɔ́n; é ka nyí to ce sín hwɛ ná jɛ wɛ un ɖe bo wá fí ǎ. "
For this reason I have asked to see you and talk with you. It is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.” ,"Nǔ e wú un byɔ́ ɖɔ ma mɔ mi, bó ná ɖɔ xó nú mi ɔ́ nɛ́; ɖó mɛ e ɖó nukún wɛ Izlayɛ́li togun ɔ́ ɖe ɔ́ wú wɛ è dǒ wlɔ mì lě.” "
"They replied, “We have not received any letters from Judea concerning you, and none of the brothers who have come from there has reported or said anything bad about you. ","Yě ka yí gbe n'i ɖɔ: “Mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, wěma ɖěbǔ wá nú mǐ sín Judée, bó ɖɔ xó nú mǐ dó wǔ towe ǎ; nɔví mǐtɔn ɖě ka gosín dɔ̌n, bó wá jɛ hwɛ towe, abǐ bó wá ɖɔ xó towe nyanya ɖé nú mǐ ǎ. "
"But we want to hear what your views are, for we know that people everywhere are talking against this sect.” ","Lo ɔ́, mǐ jló ɖɔ hwi ɖésú ní ɖɔ nǔ e a lin ɔ́ nú mǐ; ɖó mǐ tunwun ɖɔ fí bǐ jɛ́n è nɔ ɖɔ xó nyanya dó sinsɛngbɛ́ énɛ́ wú ɖe.” "
"They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, and came in even larger numbers to the place where he was staying. From morning till evening he explained and declared to them the kingdom of God and tried to convince them about Jesus from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets. ","É kpódó yě kpó ɖó azǎn, bɔ yě sukpɔ́ d'é jí, bó wá yi mɔ ɛ, ɖo xɔ e mɛ é ɖe ɔ́. Sín zǎnzǎn káká wá jɛ gbadanu ɔ́, é tín nǔ mɛ nú yě.

"I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.

"For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.” ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ ɖe lě e Mawu nɔ zé gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ ná ɖo nukɔn tɔn gbɔn ɔ́ xlɛ́; sín bǐbɛ́mɛ káká yi vivɔnu ɔ́, nǔɖiɖi kɛ́ɖɛ́ jí wɛ é nɔ zé yě dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ ná gbɔn lě e Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ gbɔn é; é wɛ nyí ɖɔ: “Mɛ e Mawu mɔ dó mɔ hwɛjijɔnɔ ɖó nǔɖiɖi tɔn wú ɔ́ ná nɔ gbɛ.” "
"The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, ","Nǔgbó mɛ e ma nɔ se tónú nú Mawu ǎ, bó nɔ́ ɖo nǔ nyanya wa wɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, Mawu nɔ́ ɖe xomɛsin tɔn xlɛ́ yě bǐ sín jǐxwé, nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ wɛ nɔ zɔ́n bɔ gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ma nɔ sixú tunwun nǔgbó ɔ́ ǎ. "
"since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. ","Mawu nɔ dɔn tó nú yě, ɖó nǔ e è hɛn ɔ́, è nǎ tunwun dó Mawu wú ɔ́ ɖo wɛn nú yě: Mawu ɖésúnɔ ɖe nǔ énɛ́ xlɛ́ yě céɖécéɖé. "
"For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities–his eternal power and divine nature–have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, sín hwenu e Mawu ko ɖó gbɛ ɔ́, nǔ e é nyí bɔ è ma nɔ mɔ ǎ ɔ́, é wɛ nyí ɖɔ: hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n tɔn mavɔ mavɔ ɔ́ kpódó nǔ e é nyí nǔgbó ɔ́ kpó ɔ́, è nɔ tunwun gbɔn nǔ e é wa lɛ́ɛ gbla mɛ; énɛ́ ɔ́ wútu ɔ́, kɛnklɛ́n sɔ́ ɖ'é mɛ nú yě ǎ. "
"For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. ","Yě tunwun Mawu; lo ɔ́, yě nɔ ná susu e jɛ xá ɛ é ǎ; yě ka nɔ lɛ́ dó kú n'i lě e é jɛ xá gbɔn é ǎ; é nyɔ́ wa ɔ́, nǔ e yě nɔ lin ɔ́ nɔ ɖó ta ɖé ǎ; nǔɖé ɖo ayixa yětɔn mɛ ǎ; ayixa yětɔn nɔ mɔ nǔ ǎ. "
"Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools ",Yě nɔ ɖɔ nǔnywɛ́tɔ́ wɛ émí nyí
and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles. ,"Yě nɔ́ gɔn susu kpa nú Mawu e ma nɔ kú ǎ é, bó nɔ kpa susu nú bǒcyɔ gbɛtɔ́ e nɔ kú é tɔn, bó nɔ́ kpa nú bǒcyɔ xɛ lɛ́ɛ tɔn, kanlin e ɖó afɔ ɛnɛ lɛ́ɛ tɔn kpódó kanlin e nɔ sá lɛ́ɛ tɔn kpán. "
Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́ wútu wɛ Mawu jǒ yě dó bɔ yě nɔ́ wa nǔblíblí lě e é jló yě gbɔn é, bó nɔ ɖo agbaza yětɔn zé dó wa winnyánú ná wɛ ɖo yěɖée tɛ́ntin. "
"They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator–who is forever praised. Amen. ","Yě gbɛ́ nǔgbó e ɖɔ xó dó Mawu wú ɔ́ yí, bó ka yí gbe nú adingban. Yě nɔ́ sɛn nǔɖíɖó Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ, bó nɔ́ se tónú nú yě, bó nɔ́ jó é ɖésúnɔ Gbɛɖótɔ́ ɔ́ dó; é wɛ è ka ɖó ná kpa susu ná káká sɔ́yi.

"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. ",Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ Mawu jó yě dó bɔ yě nɔ wa agbaza sín jlǒ e nyí winnyánú lɛ́ɛ. Nyɔ̌nu yětɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖésú nɔ́ ɖó xó xá nyɔ̌nu yě ɖɔhun lɛ́ɛ
"In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. ","Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, súnnu lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ jó nyɔ̌nu lɛ́ɛ dó, bɔ jlǒ ɖaxó ɖé nɔ dɔn yě mɛ súnnu énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ, bɔ yě nɔ ɖo winnyánú wa wɛ, kpó súnnu yě ɖɔhun lɛ́ɛ kpó.

"Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. ","Ée yě gbɛ̌ ɖɔ émí kún ná tunwun Mawu ó é ɔ́, Mawu jǒ yě dó bɔ yě nɔ wa nǔ e linlin masɔgbe yětɔn jló lɛ́ɛ é, bó nɔ́ ɖo nǔ e yě má ɖó ná wa ǎ é wa wɛ. "
"They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice.

"Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things. ","Yě tunwun ganjí ɖɔ sɛ́n Mawu tɔn ɖɔ mɛ e nɔ zán gbɛ gbɔn mɔ̌ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, kú wɛ jɛ xá yě, cóbó ka nɔ kpo ɖo nǔ mɔ̌hun lɛ́ɛ wa wɛ, lobo nɔ lɛ́ yí hwɛ dó mɛ e nɔ wa nǔ mɔ̌hun lɛ́ɛ jí.Hwi mɛ e ɖo hwɛ dó mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ wɛ ɔ́, a na bo nyí nǔ ɖěbǔnɔ ɔ́, kɛnklɛ́n sɔ́ ɖ'é mɛ nú we ǎ; ɖó hwenu e a ɖo hwɛ dó mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ wɛ, bó ka nɔ ɖo nǔ ɖokpó ɔ́ wa wɛ yě ɖɔhun ɔ́, hwɛ ɖó nú hwiɖée wɛ a ɖe.

Now we know that God's judgment against those who do such things is based on truth. ,Mǐ tunwun ɖɔ Mawu nɔ ɖɔ hwɛ xá mɛ e nɔ wa nǔ mɔ̌hun lɛ́ɛ lě e é sɔgbe xá nǔgbó ɔ́ gbɔn é. 
"So when you, a mere man, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God's judgment? ","Nya ce, hwi mɛ e nɔ ɖo hwɛ dó yě mɛ e nɔ ɖo nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ wa wɛ, bó ka ɖo nǔ ɖokpó ɔ́ wa wɛ yě ɖɔhun ɔ́, a vɛdó ɖɔ émí ná gán ɖo hwɛɖɔxámɛ Mawu tɔn mɛ wɛ sín a? "
"Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, tolerance and patience, not realizing that God's kindness leads you toward repentance?

"But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God's wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed. ",A ka tlí tó
God “will give to each person according to what he has done.” ,"Gbe énɛ́ gbe ɔ́, Mawu ná sú nǔ e mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó wa ɔ́ sín axɔ́ ɛ. "

For God does not show favoritism. ,Đó Mawu nɔ ɖe mɛɖé ɖó vo ɖo mɛ ɖé mɛ ǎ. 
"All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.

"For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous. ","Đó ényí mɛ e nɔ ɖótó sɛ́n lɛ́ɛ kpowun lɛ́ɛ wɛ nɔ nyí hwɛjijɔnɔ ɖo Mawu nukɔn ǎ; lo ɔ́, mɛ e nɔ bló nǔ e sɛ́n lɛ́ɛ zɔ́n lɛ́ɛ wɛ nɔ nyí hwɛjijɔnɔ ɖo nukɔn tɔn. "
"(Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law, ","Ényí mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ, bó ma ɖó sɛ́n lɛ́ɛ ǎ lɛ́ɛ nɔ yě ɖóɖó, bó jɛ nǔ e sɛ́n lɛ́ɛ zɔ́n lɛ́ɛ wa jí ɔ́, yě na bo ma ɖó sɛ́n lɛ́ɛ ǎ ɔ́, yě ɖe xlɛ́ ɖɔ émí tunwun nǔ e è ɖǒ ná wa é, abǐ nǔ e è ma ɖó ná wa ǎ é.

"Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised. ","Ényí a nɔ nyi sɛ́n ɔ́, ada e a gbo ɔ́ ɖó le nú we. Amɔ̌, ényí a ma ka nɔ nyi sɛ́n ɔ́ ǎ ɔ́, é cí a ma gbo ada ɖɔhun. "
"If those who are not circumcised keep the law's requirements, will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised? ","Ényí mɛ e ma gbo ada ǎ é ka nɔ wa nǔ e sɛ́n ɔ́ zɔ́n ɔ́, Mawu ná sɔ́ ɛ dó mɔ mɛ e gbo ada é ná ǎ wɛ a? "
"The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker. ","Mɛ e ma gbo ada ǎ, bó ka nɔ nyi sɛ́n lɛ́ɛ na ɖɔ hwɛ xá hwi mɛ e nyí Jwifu bo gbo ada, bó ɖó sɛ́nwéma ɔ́, bó ma ka nɔ wa nǔ e è wlán d'é mɛ lɛ́ɛ ǎ é. "
"A man is not a Jew if he is only one outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, mɛ e nyí Jwifu nǔgbó nǔgbó ɔ́ wɛ nyí mɛ e nyí ɖo nukún ta lɛ́ɛ ǎ; é ka nyí mɛ e è gbo ada ná kpowun ɖo wěxo é ǎ. "
"No, a man is a Jew if he is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a man's praise is not from men, but from God.What advantage, then, is there in being a Jew, or what value is there in circumcision? ","Lo ɔ́, mɛ e nyí Jwifu nǔgbó nǔgbó ɔ́ wɛ nyí mɛ e nyí Jwifu ɖo ayi mɛ é, mɛ e gbo ada ɖo ayi mɛ é. Ada énɛ́ ɔ́, Yɛ Mawu tɔn wɛ nɔ gbo nú mɛ; ényí nǔ e è wlán dó sɛ́nwéma mɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ nɔ́ gbo nú mɛ ǎ.

"Not at all! Let God be true, and every man a liar. As it is written: “So that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge.” ","Gbeɖé kpɔ́n!

"But if our unrighteousness brings out God's righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.)

"Certainly not! If that were so, how could God judge the world? ","Gbeɖé kpɔ́n! Xógbe énɛ́ sɔgbe ǎ; ɖó ényí Mawu nɔ́ dó hwɛ agɔ ɔ́, nɛ̌ wɛ é ka ná sixú ɖɔ hwɛ xá gbɛ ɔ́ gbɔn? "
"Someone might argue, “If my falsehood enhances God's truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?” ","Lo ɔ́, ényí adingban ce nɔ lɛ́ ɖe nǔgbó Mawu tɔn xlɛ́ d'é jí, bó nɔ́ sɔ́ ɛ su ɔ́, étɛ́ wú Mawu ka ná ɖó hwɛ nú mì hwɛhutɔ́ wɛ un nyí ɖɔhun? "
Why not say–as we are being slanderously reported as saying and as some claim that we say–“Let us do evil that good may result”? Their condemnation is deserved. ,"Ényí mɔ̌ wɛ é nyí ɔ́, étɛ́wú mǐ ma ka ná ɖɔ mi wá nú mǐ ná wa nǔ nyanya bónú nǔ ɖagbe ná tɔ́n sín mɛ ǎ? Mɛ e jló ná ɖɔ xó ce nyanya lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ ɖɔ mɔ̌ wɛ nyi nɔ ɖɔ.

What shall we conclude then? Are we any better? Not at all! We have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under sin. ,"Lo ɔ́, étɛ́ ka wɛ?

“There is no fear of God before their eyes.” ,Yě nɔ́ sí Mawu ɖěbǔ ɖo gbɛzán yětɔn mɛ ǎ.” 
"Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God. ","Mǐ ka tunwun ɖɔ nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ sɛ́n lɛ́ɛ ɖe ɔ́ bǐ ɔ́, mɛ e ɖo sɛ́n lɛ́ɛ glɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ ná wɛ yě ɖe, bónú è nǎ xwe nu yětɔn dó xɔ, bónú Mawu ná ɖɔ hwɛ xá gbɛtɔ́ e ɖo gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ. "
"Therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin.

"But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. ","Amɔ̌, din ɔ́, Mawu xlɛ́ mǐ lě e é nɔ́ sɔ́ mǐ dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ ná gbɔn é.

and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. ,"Amɔ̌, Mawu ɔ́, ɖo xomɛnyínyɔ́ tɔn mɛ ɔ́, é sɔ́ yě mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú Klísu Jezu lɛ́ɛ bǐ dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ ná vɔ̌nu ɖo nukún tɔn mɛ gbɔn Klísu Jezu e nɔ ɖe yě sín hwɛ mɛ ɔ́ jí. "
"God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished– ","Mawu sɔ́ Klísu ɖó te nú vɔ̌sísá, bónú gbɔn hun tɔn gbla mɛ ɔ́, Klísu ná mɔ hwɛ sɔ́ kɛ mɛ yí nú mɛ e ɖi nǔ n'i lɛ́ɛ é.

"he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus. ","Amɔ̌, din ɔ́, é ɖe lě e é nɔ́ sɔ́ gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ ɖo nukún tɔn mɛ gbɔn ɔ́ xlɛ́, ɖó é nyí hwɛjijɔnɔ, bó ná lɛ́ sɔ́ mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌ dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ. "
"Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On that of observing the law? No, but on that of faith. ","Hǔn, nǔ e wú gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ná ɖó dó, bó dó yí go ɔ́ ɖě sɔ́ tíin a? Éeǒ!

For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from observing the law. ,Đó mǐ mɔ ɖɔ nǔ e gbɛtɔ́ ɖi nú Klísu ɔ́ wɛ nɔ zɔ́n bɔ Mawu nɔ́ sɔ́ ɛ dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ ná ɖo nukún tɔn mɛ
"Is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too, ","Abǐ, Mawu ɔ́, Jwifu lɛ́ɛ sín Mawu kɛ́ɖɛ́ wɛ é nyí a? É nyí togun ɖě lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌ tɔn ǎ cé? Ɛɛn, é nyí Mawu togun ɖě lɛ́ɛ lɔ tɔn ganjí. "
"since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith. ","Đó Mawu ɖokpó géé wɛ tíin, bó ná kpɔ́n dó nǔɖiɖi e Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ɖó ɔ́ wú, bó ná sɔ́ yě dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ ná; mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, é ná lɛ́ kpɔ́n dó nǔɖiɖi e mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌ ɖó ɔ́ wú, bó ná sɔ́ yě dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ. "
"Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, discovered in this matter? ","Ée mǐ ɖɔ Mawu nɔ sɔ́ mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú Klísu lɛ́ɛ dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ na ɔ́ wɛ zɔ́n bɔ è nǎ ɖɔ sɛ́n lɛ́ɛ nyí nǔ yǎyá a? Gbeɖé kpɔ́n!

"If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about–but not before God. ","Ényí nǔ e Ablaxámu wa é wú wɛ Mawu mɔ ɛ dó mɔ hwɛjijɔnɔ ná ɔ́, Ablaxámu hɛn ɔ́, é ná yí go; é ka sixú yí go ɖo Mawu nukɔn ǎ. "
"What does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.” ","Đó Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Ablaxámu ɖi nǔ nú Mawu, bɔ Mawu kpɔ́n dó nǔ e é ɖi n'i ɔ́ wú, bó mɔ ɛ dó mɔ hwɛjijɔnɔ.” "
"Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to him as a gift, but as an obligation. ","Mǐ tunwun ɖɔ mɛ e wa azɔ̌ ɔ́, è nɔ sú axɔ́ ɛ; axɔ́ énɛ́ e è sú i ɔ́, nǎ wɛ è nǎ ɛ vɔ̌nu ǎ; axɔ́ wɛ é nyí bɔ è ɖu dó e. "
"However, to the man who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness. ","Lo ɔ́, ényí mɛɖé nɔ azɔ̌ ma wa, bó ka ɖi nǔ nú Mawu e nɔ́ mɔ mɛ e ma nɔ sí i ɖ'ayǐ ǎ lɛ́ɛ dó mɔ hwɛjijɔnɔ ɔ́, é ná kpɔ́n dó nǔ e é ɖi n'i ɔ́ wú, bó ná mɔ ɛ dó mɔ hwɛjijɔnɔ. "
David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works: ,"Mɛ e Mawu ma kpɔ́n dó azɔ̌ tɔn lɛ́ɛ wú ǎ, bó mɔ ɛ dó mɔ hwɛjijɔnɔ ɔ́, lě e Davídi ɖɔ nǔ nyɔ́ n'i gbɔn é ɖíe; Davídi ɖɔ: "
"“Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. ",“Nǔ nyɔ́ nú mɛ e Aklúnɔ ɖe agɔ e yě jɛ lɛ́ɛ sín kɔ ná lɛ́ɛ é
Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will never count against him.” ,Nǔ nyɔ́ nú mɛ e Aklúnɔ ma xa hwɛ dó kɔ ná ǎ é.” 
"Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness. ","Nyɔ̌ná énɛ́ ɔ́, mɛ e gbo ada lɛ́ɛ kɛ́ɖɛ́ tɔn wɛ é nyí a? Éeǒ! É nyí mɛ e gbo ada lɛ́ɛ kɛ́ɖɛ́ tɔn ǎ. É lɛ́ nyí mɛ e ma gbo ada ǎ lɛ́ɛ lɔ tɔn. Mǐ ko ɖɔ din ɖɔ: “Ablaxámu ɖi nǔ nú Mawu, bɔ Mawu kpɔ́n dó nǔɖiɖi tɔn wú, bó mɔ ɛ dó mɔ hwɛjijɔnɔ.” "
"Under what circumstances was it credited? Was it after he was circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before! ","Nɛ̌ Ablaxámu ka ɖe gbɔn hwenɛ́nu? É kó gbo ada cóbɔ Mawu mɔ ɛ dó mɔ hwɛjijɔnɔ wɛ a, abǐ é kó gbo ada ǎ? Éeǒ! É kó gbo ada cóbɔ Mawu mɔ ɛ dó mɔ hwɛjijɔnɔ ǎ. "
"And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo wɛ Ablaxámu wá gbó ada, bɔ é nyí wuntun ɖé n'i. Wuntun énɛ́ wɛ ɖe xlɛ́ ɖɔ Mawu mɔ ɛ dó mɔ hwɛjijɔnɔ, ɖó nǔ e é ɖi n'i cóbó wá gbo ada é wú.

And he is also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised. ,"É lɛ́ nyí mɛ e gbo ada lɛ́ɛ sín tɔ́; é nyí mɛ e gbo ada kpowun lɛ́ɛ wɛ ǎ; lo ɔ́, mɛ e gbo ada, bó nɔ lɛ́ tɛ afɔ afɔdo tɔ́gbó mǐtɔn Ablaxámu tɔn mɛ, ɖo nǔɖiɖi sín alixo lɛ́ɛ wɛ: Ablaxámu ɔ́ kó ɖi nǔ cóbó wá gbo ada. "
"It was not through law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith. ",Mawu dó akpá nú Ablaxámu kpódó vǐ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó ɖɔ gbɛ ɔ́ ná nyí yětɔn. Sɛ́n e é nɔ nyi ɔ́ wútu wɛ Mawu dó akpá énɛ́ ɔ́ ǎ
"For if those who live by law are heirs, faith has no value and the promise is worthless, ","Đó é nyí mɛ e nɔ wa nǔ e sɛ́n ɔ́ zɔ́n lɛ́ɛ wɛ ná mɔ nǔ e sín akpá Mawu dó ɔ́ yí ɔ́, hǔn nǔɖiɖi ɔ́ nyí nǔ yǎyá, bɔ akpá e Mawu dó ɔ́ sɔ́ na nyí nǔɖé wa nú ǎ. "
because law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression. ,"Đó sɛ́n ɔ́ nɔ dɔn xomɛsin Mawu tɔn kpó hwɛɖɔxámɛ tɔn kpó wá; amɔ̌ fí e sɛ́n ɖé ma ka ɖe ǎ ɔ́, è sixú gba sɛ́n ɖo fínɛ́ ǎ. "
"Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham's offspring–not only to those who are of the law but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, Mawu dó akpá ɖó nǔɖiɖi wútu, bónú é ná nyí nǔníná vɔ̌nu Mawu tɔn, bónú akpá énɛ́ e é dó ɔ́ na nyí Ablaxámu sín vǐ lɛ́ɛ bǐ tɔn.

"As it is written: “I have made you a father of many nations.” He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed–the God who gives life to the dead and calls things that are not as though they were. ","Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Un sɔ́ we dó ɖó tɔ́ nú akɔta wɔ̌buwɔ́bú.” É wɛ nyí tɔ́ mǐtɔn ɖo Mawu e é ɖi nǔ na ɔ́ nukún mɛ; Mawu e nɔ ná gbɛ mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ, bó nɔ ɖɔ xó kpowun bɔ nǔ e ma ko tíin ǎ lɛ́ɛ nɔ tíin é. "
"Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, “So shall your offspring be.” ","Ablaxámu ɖi nǔ, bó ɖó nukún nǔ; nǔ ɖěbǔ ka ɖe bɔ è sixú ɖó nukún ǎ; nǔ ɖo mɔ̌ có Ablaxámu ɖi nǔ, bó ɖó nukún nǔ.

"Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead–since he was about a hundred years old–and that Sarah's womb was also dead. ","Ablaxámu ko ɖó xwe kanwe ko (100) mɔ̌, bó kó mɔ ɖɔ nǔ gbɛ́ dó agbaza émítɔn, bɔ asi émítɔn Sala lɔ sín xwe ko sɛ yi, bɔ é kún sɔ́ sixú ji vǐ ó; lo ɔ́, nǔɖiɖi tɔn vɔ́ da ǎ. "
"Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, ","É jó nǔɖiɖi dó ǎ; é ka xo nǔ kpɔ́n dó akpá e Mawu dó n'i ɔ́ wú ǎ; é nyɔ́ wa ɔ́, nǔɖiɖi tɔn ná ɛ hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n, bɔ é nɔ kpa susu nú Mawu. "
being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised. ,"Đó é ɖeji bǐ dégbédégbé ɖɔ Mawu ɖó hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n, bó ná ɖe akpá e é dó nú émí é. "
This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.” ,Énɛ́ wútu wɛ Mawu mɔ Ablaxámu dó mɔ hwɛjijɔnɔ ɖó nǔ e é ɖi n'i ɔ́ wútu. 
"The words “it was credited to him” were written not for him alone, ","Lo ɔ́, xógbe élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ e è wlán bó ɖɔ: “É mɔ ɛ dó mɔ hwɛjijɔnɔ” ɔ́, é nyí Ablaxámu kɛ́ɖɛ́ wútu wɛ è wlán ǎ. "
"but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness–for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. ",È lɛ́ wlán yě nú mǐ mɛ e è ná mɔ dó mɔ hwɛjijɔnɔ lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌
"He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, ","Mawu jǒ Jezu nú kú ɖó hwɛ mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ tamɛ, bɔ é ka fɔ́n wá gbɛ, bó ná sɔ́ mǐ dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ ɖo nukún tɔn mɛ.Hǔn, ée Mawu sɔ́ mǐ dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ gbɔn nǔɖiɖi gbla mɛ ɔ́, fífá ɖo mǐ kpo Mawu kpo tɛ́ntin, gbɔn Aklúnɔ mǐtɔn Jezu Klísu sín nǔwiwa lɛ́ɛ gbla mɛ.

"And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us. ","Nukúnɖíɖó énɛ́ ka nɔ flú mɛ ǎ, ɖó Mawu kɔn wǎn yíyí tɔn dó ayi mǐtɔn mɛ gbɔn Yɛsinsɛn e é ná mǐ ɔ́ jí. "
"You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. ","Đó hwenu e mǐ ma kó ɖó gǎn ɖé ǎ ɔ́, Klísu kú dó mǐ mɛ e ma nɔ sí Mawu ǎ lɛ́ɛ tamɛ, ɖo hwenu e Mawu ɖó dó é. "

"For if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!

"for before the law was given, sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when there is no law. ","Cóbónú Mawu ná ná sɛ́n ɔ́ Mɔyízi ɔ́, hwɛhuhu ko tíin ɖo gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ; lo ɔ́, ée sɛ́n ɔ́ ma kó ɖe ǎ ɔ́, Mawu nɔ lɛ́n hwɛ dó kɔ nú mɛɖé ɖ'ayǐ ǎ. "
"Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come. ","É ɖo mɔ̌ có, bɛ́ sín Adámu hwenu ɖokpóó káká wá jɛ Mɔyízi hwenu ɔ́, kú ɔ́ ɖu axɔ́sú; é ɖu axɔ́sú ɖo mɛ e sín hwɛ ma tlɛ cí hwɛ e Adámu hu é ɖɔhun ǎ lɛ́ɛ lɔ jí; Adámu e vɛ́ tóli nú Mawu é. Adámu ɔ́, mɛ e ɖó ná wá ɔ́ sín akpajlɛ́ wɛ é nyí. "
"But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! ","È sixú jlɛ́ nǔníná Mawu tɔn vɔ̌nu ɔ́ dó nǔ e Adámu wa nyi do ɔ́ wú ǎ; ɖó é sín nǔ e gbɛtɔ́ ɖokpó géé énɛ́ wa nyi do ɔ́ wú, bɔ mɛ gěgé kú; lo ɔ́ fɛ́nú Mawu tɔn ɔ́ hú gǎn nǔwanyido Adámu tɔn ɔ́ ɖaxó, bɔ nǔníná e é ná mɛ gěgé vɔ̌nu gbɔn gbɛtɔ́ ɖokpó géé jí ɔ́ (Jezu Klísu) lɛ́ ɖo tají hú mɔ̌. "
"Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man's sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification. ",Nǔ e nǔníná Mawu tɔn nɔ wa ɔ́ gbɔn vo nú nǔ e hwɛ e gbɛtɔ́ ɖokpó géé (Adámu) énɛ́ hu ɔ́ dɔn wá é. Đó hwɛ e è ɖɔ dó nǔwanyido gbɛtɔ́ ɖokpó géé énɛ́ tɔn ɔ́ dɔn hwɛɖónúmɛ wá gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ. Nǔníná vɔ̌nu e Mawu ná mǐ dó nǔwanyido gěgé gúdo ɔ́ ɖe mǐ sín hwɛ mɛ. 
"For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ. ","Ée é sín nǔ e gbɛtɔ́ ɖokpó géé wa nyi do ɔ́ wú, bɔ kú ɖu axɔ́sú gbɔn gbɛtɔ́ ɖokpó géé énɛ́ jí ɔ́, é ɖo gannaganna ɖɔ mɛ e Mawu ná fɛ́nú kpódó nǔníná hwɛjijɔ tɔn kpó, bɔ é túnflá lɛ́ɛ ná nɔ gbɛ bó ná ɖu axɔ́sú ɖo hwɛhuhu jí, ɖó nǔ e Jezu-Klísu wa é wútu. "
"Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men. ","Hǔn nǔ e gbɛtɔ́ ɖokpó géé wa nyi do ɔ́ dɔn hwɛɖónúmɛ wá nú gbɛtɔ́ bǐ, mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́ jɛ́n azɔ̌ jlɔ́jlɔ́ e gbɛtɔ́ ɖokpó géé (Jezu Klísu) wa ɔ́ ɖe gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ sín hwɛɖónúmɛ mɛ, bó ná gbɛ yě. "
"For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous. ","Đó lě e tónúmase gbɛtɔ́ ɖokpó géé tɔn zɔ́n bɔ gbɛtɔ́ gěgé húzú hwɛhutɔ́ ɔ́, mɔ̌ jɛ́n tónúsise gbɛtɔ́ ɖokpó géé tɔn zɔ́n bɔ gbɛtɔ́ gěgé húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ ɖo Mawu nukún mɛ. "
"The law was added so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more, ","Sɛ́n ɔ́ wá, bónú hwɛhuhu ná sukpɔ́; fí e hwɛhuhu ka sukpɔ́ ɖe ɔ́, fɛ́nú Mawu tɔn nɔ túnflá ɖo fínɛ́. "
"so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? ","Hǔn énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ lě e hwɛhuhu ko ɖu axɔ́sú gbɔn kú jí ɔ́, mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́ jɛ́n fɛ́nú Mawu tɔn ɖo axɔ́sú ɖu wɛ gbɔn hwɛjijɔ jí, bó ná kplá mǐ yi gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ mɛ gbɔn Jezu Klísu Aklúnɔ mǐtɔn jí.Étɛ́ mǐ ka ná ɖɔ din?

By no means! We died to sin,Fon
Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? ,"Abǐ mi tunwun ɖɔ mǐ mɛ e ko lɛ yɛhwesin, bó ɖo bǔ xá Klísu Jezu lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mǐ bǐ kú kú e Klísu kú ɔ́ ǎ cé? "
"We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. ","Hwenu e è lɛ yɛhwesin nú mǐ ɔ́, mǐ kú xá Klísu, bɔ è ɖi mǐ kpó e kpó, bónú lě e Mawu Tɔ́ ɔ́ sɔ́ hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n tɔn susunɔ ɔ́ dó fɔ́n Klísu ná ɔ́, mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, mǐ lɔ ná zán gbɛ yɔ̌yɔ́. "
"If we have been united with him like this in his death, we will certainly also be united with him in his resurrection. ","Đó ée mǐ ko ɖo bǔ xá ɛ, bó ko kú xá ɛ ɔ́, mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́ jɛ́n mǐ ɖo bǔ xá ɛ bó ko fɔ́n sín kú xá ɛ. "
"For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin– ","Mǐ tunwun ganjí ɖɔ gbɛtɔ́ e mǐ ko nyí ɖ'ayǐ ɔ́, ká wɛ è ko ká gbɛtɔ́ énɛ́ kpódó Klísu kpó nyi aklúzu jí, bó ná sú kún dó nú hwɛhuhu sín ninɔmɛ e mǐ ɖó ɖ'ayǐ é, bónú mǐ ma sɔ́ nyí kannumɔ nú hwɛhuhu ɖě ó. "
because anyone who has died has been freed from sin. ,Đó mɛ e kú ɔ́ gosín hwɛhuhu sín hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n kan nu. 
"Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. ","Ée mǐ kú xá Klísu ɔ́, mǐ ɖi nǔ ɖɔ mǐ lɔmɔ̌ mǐ ná nɔ gbɛ xá ɛ. "
"For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him. ","Đó mǐ tunwun ɖɔ ée Mawu fɔ́n Klísu sín kú ɔ́, Klísu kún sɔ́ ná kú ó; ɖó kú sɔ́ ɖó acɛ ɖo jǐ tɔn ǎ. "
"The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. ","Đó Klísu kú; hwɛhuhu sɔ́ ná ɖó hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n ɖé ǎ wútu wɛ é kú azɔn ɖokpó géé, bɔ xó fó. Lo ɔ́, Klísu fɔ́n wá gbɛ; é ná nɔ gbɛ nú Mawu wútu wɛ é fɔ́n wá gbɛ. "
"In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. ","Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, ɖo bǔ e mǐ ɖe xá Klísu Jezu ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, mi lɔmɔ̌ mi ní nɔ mɔ miɖée dó mɔ mɛ e ko kú ɖo hwɛhuhu sín alixo ɔ́ na bo nɔ mɔ miɖée dó mɔ mɛ e ɖo gbɛ nú Mawu ɔ́ ná. "
Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. ,"Hǔn, hwɛhuhu ní ma ɖu axɔ́sú ɖo agbaza mitɔn e ná kú ɔ́ nu ó; mi ma se tónú nú jló agbaza tɔn lɛ́ɛ ó. "
"Do not offer the parts of your body to sin, as instruments of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer the parts of your body to him as instruments of righteousness. ","Mi ma sɔ́ miɖée dó wa azɔ̌ nú hwɛhuhu azɔ̌wanú e nɔ wa nǔ agɔ lɛ́ɛ é ɖɔhun ó; é nyɔ́ wa ɔ́, mi sɔ́ miɖée jó nú Mawu, ɖó mɛ e fɔ́n sín kú é wɛ mi nyí; mi sɔ́ miɖée bǐ jó nú azɔ̌ tɔn, azɔ̌wanú e nɔ wa nǔ jlɔ́jlɔ́ lɛ́ɛ é ɖɔhun. "
"For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace. ","Đó hwɛhuhu ná ɖó acɛ ɖo mi jí ǎ; ɖó mi sɔ́ ɖo sɛ́n ɔ́ sín acɛ mɛ ǎ; lo ɔ́, fɛ́nú Mawu tɔn mɛ wɛ mi ɖe. "
What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means! ,"Étɛ́ o! Ée mǐ ma ɖo sɛ́n ɔ́ sín acɛ mɛ ǎ, bó ɖo fɛ́nú Mawu tɔn mɛ ɔ́ wú wɛ mǐ ná hu hwɛ a? Gbeɖé kpɔ́n! "
"Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey him as slaves, you are slaves to the one whom you obey–whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness? ","Mi tunwun ganjí ɖɔ ényí mi jó miɖée dó kannumɔ ɖɔhun nú mɛɖé, bó ná se tónú n'i ɔ́, kannumɔ mɛ e se tónú ná wɛ mi ɖe ɔ́ tɔn wɛ mi nyí.

"But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you were entrusted. ","Lo ɔ́, è ní kpa susu nú Mawu! Mi mɛ e ko nyí kannumɔ nú hwɛhuhu ɖ'ayǐ ɔ́, din ɔ́, mi se tónú kpódó ayixa mitɔn bǐ sésé kpo nú kpɔ́ndéwú e ɖo kplɔ́n e mi yí ɔ́ mɛ é. "
You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness. ,"È hwlɛ̌n mi gán sín hwɛ sín acɛ mɛ, bɔ mi húzú kannumɔ nú hwɛjijɔ. "
"I put this in human terms because you are weak in your natural selves. Just as you used to offer the parts of your body in slavery to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer them in slavery to righteousness leading to holiness. ","Un ɖo xó ɖɔ nú mi wɛ lě e gbɛtɔ́ nɔ ɖɔ xó gbɔn é, ɖó nukúnnú e mi ma nɔ yá wǔ mɔ jɛ nǔ e kan Mawu lɛ́ɛ mɛ ǎ wútu.

"When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness. ","Hwenu e mi nyí hwɛ sín kannumɔ ɖ'ayǐ ɔ́, é ɖo dandan nú mi ɖɔ mi ní nɔ wa nǔ jlɔ́jlɔ́ ǎ. "
What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death! ,"Nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ e mi wa ɖ'ayǐ, bɔ é ɖo winnyá nyí nú mi wɛ din ɔ́, étɛ́ mi ka mɔ ɖ'é mɛ? Nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, kú wɛ yě nɔ dɔn mɛ yi. "
"But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life. ","Amɔ̌, din ɔ́, è ɖe mi sín hwɛhuhu sín acɛ mɛ, bɔ mi ɖo azɔ̌ wa nú Mawu wɛ. Nǔ e mi ná mɔ ɖ'é mɛ ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ mi na zán gbɛ mímɛ́, bɔ vivɔnu ɔ́, mi ná mɔ gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ. "
"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.Do you not know, brothers–for I am speaking to men who know the law–that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives? ","Đó axɔ́ e hwɛhuhu nɔ sú mɛ ɔ́ wɛ nyí kú; amɔ̌ nǔ e Mawu nɔ ná mɛ vɔ̌nu ɔ́ wɛ nyí gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ e mǐ ɖó ɖo bǔ e mǐ ɖe xá Klísu Jezu Aklúnɔ mǐtɔn mɛ é.Nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, nǔ e ná ɖɔ nú mi wɛ un ɖe ɔ́, mi ko tunwun, ɖó mi tunwun sɛ́n ɔ́. Hwenu e gbɛtɔ́ ɖo gbɛ ɔ́ jɛ́n sɛ́n ɔ́ nɔ kpa acɛ n'i. "
"For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage. ","Nǔ e wú è nǎ kpɔ́n dó ɔ́ ɖíe: nyɔ̌nu e ɖo asúxwé ɔ́, sɛ́n ɔ́ cá ɛ dó asú tɔn wú, káká yi jɛ hwenu e asú tɔn ná nɔ gbɛ xɔ é bǐ; lo ɔ́, ényí asú ɔ́ kú ɔ́, nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ gosín sɛ́n e cá ɛ dó asú tɔn wú ɔ́ sín acɛ mɛ. "
"So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man. ","Hǔn ényí nyɔ̌nu énɛ́ jó éɖée dó nú súnnu ɖěvo hwenu e asú tɔn kpo ɖo gbɛ ɔ́, è nǎ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ agalɛtɔ́; lo ɔ́, ényí asú tɔn kú ɔ́, ɖo sɛ́n ɔ́ sín alixo ɔ́, é jɛ éɖée sí, bó hɛn ɔ́, é ná húzú súnnu ɖěvo sín asi; hwe énɛ́ ɔ́ nu ɔ́, è sɔ́ na ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ agalɛtɔ́ ǎ. "
"So, my brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God. ","Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́ nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, ɖo sɛ́n ɔ́ sín alixo ɔ́, mi lɔmɔ̌ ɔ́, mi ko kú. Ée mi cá miɖée xá Klísu ɔ́, kú wɛ mi ko kú ɖo sɛ́n ɔ́ sín alixo. Din ɔ́, mɛ ɖěvo tɔn wɛ mi nyí; mɛ e fɔ́n sín kú é tɔn wɛ mi nyí, bónú mǐ ná nɔ́ wa nǔ e nyɔ́ Mawu nukún mɛ é. "
"For when we were controlled by the sinful nature, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, so that we bore fruit for death. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, hwenu e mǐ ɖó hwɛhuhu sín ninɔmɛ ɖ'ayǐ ɔ́, jló nyanya e sɛ́n ɔ́ nɔ dɔn wá lɛ́ɛ nɔ wa azɔ̌ ɖo agbaza mǐtɔn bǐ mɛ, bó nɔ kplá mǐ yi kú. "
"But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code. ","Amɔ̌, din ɔ́, è ko ɖe mǐ sín sɛ́n ɔ́ sín acɛ mɛ; mǐ ko kú ɖo sɛ́n énɛ́ e hɛn mǐ dó hɛn gantɔ́ é sín alixo; hǔn din ɔ́, mǐ hɛn ɔ́, mǐ ná zé walɔ yɔ̌yɔ́ ɔ́ dó wa azɔ̌ nú Mawu, ɖo Yɛsinsɛn ɔ́ sín acɛ mɛ; é sɔ́ ná nyí walɔ xóxó e mǐ nɔ dó wa azɔ̌ n'i ɖo sɛ́n e è wlǎn ɔ́ sín acɛ mɛ é ǎ. "
"What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, “Do not covet.” ","Étɛ́ mǐ ka ná ɖɔ lo? Sɛ́n ɔ́ hwɛhuhu wɛ é nyí a? Gbeɖé kpɔ́n! Sɛ́n ɔ́ wɛ zɔ́n bɔ un tunwun nǔ e nyí hwɛhuhu é; ɖó sɛ́n ɔ́ ma ɖɔ: “Nukún towe ní má nɔ nɔzo towe sín nǔɖé wú ó” ǎ ɔ́, un ná tunwun nǔ e nyí mɛɖévonú jlójló é ǎ. "
"But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from law, sin is dead. ","Ali e sɛ́n ɔ́ ɖe ɔ́ jí wɛ hwɛhuhu gbɔn, bó sɔ́ mɛnújlójló alɔkpa lɛ́ɛ bǐ dó ayi mɛ nú mǐ; ɖó sɛ́n ɔ́ ma tíin ǎ ɔ́, hwɛhuhu ɖó acɛ ɖé ǎ. "
"Once I was alive apart from law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died. ","Đ'ayǐ ɔ́, hwenu e sɛ́n ɔ́ ma ɖe ǎ ɔ́, un ɖo gbɛ; amɔ̌, ée sɛ́n ɔ́ wá jɛ nǔ e è ma ɖó ná wa ǎ lɛ́ɛ ɖe tɔ́n jí ɔ́, hwɛhuhu ɔ́ bɛ́ azɔ̌wiwa, "
I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death. ,"bɔ nyɛ kú: sɛ́n e ɖó ná ná gbɛ mɛ ɔ́, kú wɛ é dɔn mì yi. "
"For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death. ","Đó hwɛhuhu ɔ́ xwedó ali e é mɔ ɔ́, bó flú mì gbɔn sɛ́n ɔ́ jí; é lɛ́ gbɔn sɛ́n ɖokpó énɛ́ jí, bó hu mì. "
"So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good. ","Hǔn sɛ́n ɔ́, nǔ mímɛ́ wɛ é nyí bɔ nǔ e é nɔ zɔ́n mɛ ɔ́ lɔ nyí nǔ mímɛ́, lobo nyí nǔ jlɔ́jlɔ́, nǔ ɖagbe. "
"Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful. ","Nǔ e nyí nǔ ɖagbe ɔ́, nǔ e nɔ́ hu mɛ ɔ́ wɛ é húzú nú nyɛ a? Gbeɖé kpɔ́n! Hwɛhuhu wɛ zɔ́n bɔ un kú; hwɛhuhu ɔ́, ninɔmɛ titewungbe e é ɖó ɔ́ wɛ é ɖe xlɛ́ gbɔn mɔ̌.

"We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, mǐ tunwun ɖɔ sɛ́n ɔ́, Mawu gɔ́n wɛ é gosín; nyɛ ɔ́, un ka ɖó hwɛhuhu sín ninɔmɛ, bɔ è sa mì nú hwɛhuhu. "
"I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. ",Đó un nɔ tunwun nǔ e wa wɛ un ɖe ɔ́ ǎ
"And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. ","Ée é nyí ɖɔ nǔ e un ma jló ná wa ǎ ɔ́ wɛ un nɔ wa ɔ́, un mɔ ɖɔ sɛ́n ɔ́, nǔ ɖagbe wɛ é nyí, gbɔn nǔ e un nɔ wa gbɔn mɔ̌ ɔ́ gbla mɛ. "
"As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. ","Ényí nǔ cí mɔ̌ ɔ́, hǔn nǔ e wa wɛ un ɖe ɔ́, nyɛ ɖésú wɛ ɖo blǒbló wɛ ǎ; lo ɔ́, hwɛhuhu e ɖo nyɛ mɛ ɔ́ wɛ ɖo nǔ wa gbɔn mɔ̌ wɛ. "
"I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. ","Đó un tunwun ɖɔ nǔ ɖagbe wiwa kún ɖo ayixa ce mɛ ó; é wɛ nyí ɖɔ nǔ ɖagbe wiwa ɖo hwɛhuhu sín ninɔmɛ e un ɖó ɔ́ mɛ ǎ; ɖó un jló bó ná wa nǔ ɖagbe; amɔ̌, un ɖó hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n e ná wa é ǎ. "
"For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do–this I keep on doing. ","Nǔ ɖagbe e un nɔ jló ná wa ɔ́, un nɔ wa ǎ; lo ɔ́, nǔ nyanya e un ma jló ǎ ɔ́ wɛ un nɔ wa. "
"Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it. ","Ényí un ka nɔ bló nǔ e un ma jló ná wa ǎ ɔ́, hǔn é sɔ́ nyí nyɛ ɖésúnɔ wɛ ɖo nǔ wa gbɔn mɔ̌ wɛ ǎ, lo ɔ́ hwɛhuhu e ɖo ayi ce mɛ ɔ́ wɛ ɖo nǔ wa gbɔn mɔ̌ wɛ. "
"So I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me. ","Hǔn, nǔ e un wá mɔ ɖo nyɛɖée mɛ ɔ́ ɖíe: un jló na wa ɖagbe hweɖěbǔnu ɔ́, nǔ nyanya kɛ́ɖɛ́ wú jɛ́n un nɔ kpé, bó nɔ wa. "
For in my inner being I delight in God's law,Fon
"but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members. ","Amɔ̌, sɛ́n ɖěvo tíin ɖo agbaza ce mɛ, bó ɖo hun xo xá sɛ́n e ɖo linlin ce mɛ é wɛ, bó sɔ́ mì dó ɖó gantɔ́ nú hwɛhuhu sɛ́n e ɖo agbaza ce mɛ é. "
What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? ,Gbɛ ce blá wǔ
"Thanks be to God–through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, ","Mi ní kpa susu nú Mawu gbɔn Jezu Klísu Aklúnɔ mǐtɔn jí.

because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death. ,"Đó Yɛsinsɛn e nɔ na gbɛ mɛ, ɖo bǔ e è ɖe xá Klísu Jezu ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́ sín sɛ́n hwlɛ́n mì ɖo sɛ́n e nɔ ɖe hwɛhuhu kpódó kú kpó xlɛ́ mì ɔ́ sí. "
"For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in sinful man, ","Nǔ e Mɔyízisɛ́n ɔ́ ma kpé wú bó bló ǎ ɖó hwɛhuhu sín ninɔmɛ e gbɛtɔ́ ɖó ɔ́ zɔ́n bɔ é vɔ́da wútu ɔ́, Mawu bló: é sɛ́ Vǐ é ɖésúnɔ tɔn dó, ɖó hwɛhuhu ɔ́ wútu, bɔ é zɔn agbaza mɛ wá; agbaza e mɛ é zɔn wá ɔ́ cí hwɛhuhu sín agbaza e gbɛtɔ́ ɖó é ɖɔhun. Mawu bló mɔ̌, bó dó ɖó hwɛ nú hwɛhuhu ɖo gbɛtɔ́ sín agbaza mɛ. "
"in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit. ","Mawu bló nǔ énɛ́ ɔ́, bónú nǔ e sɛ́n ɔ́ ɖɔ è ɖǒ na wa ɔ́, ní nyí wiwa ɖo mǐ mɛ; mǐ mɛ e ma sɔ́ nɔ zán gbɛ mǐtɔn lě e hwɛhuhu sín ninɔmɛ e mǐ ɖó ɔ́ jló gbɔn ɔ́ ǎ, bó nɔ zán lě e Yɛsinsɛn jló gbɔn é. "
Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires,Fon
"The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace; ","Ényí ayixa mɛtɔn ɖo hwɛhuhu sín nǔ lɛ́ɛ jí ɔ́, kú wɛ é nɔ kplá mɛ yi; ayixa mɛtɔn ka ɖo Yɛsinsɛn sín nǔ lɛ́ɛ jí ɔ́, é nɔ kplá mɛ bɔ è nɔ mɔ gbɛ, bó nɔ mɔ fífá. "
"the sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so. ","Mɛ e jí ninɔmɛ hwɛhuhu tɔn sín nǔ lɛ́ɛ nɔ ɖu gǎn ɖe lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, kɛntɔ́ Mawu tɔn wɛ yě nyǐ; ɖó yě nɔ yí gbe bó nɔ́ nɔ Mawusɛ́n ɔ́ sín acɛ mɛ ǎ; yě ka sixú kpé wú lɔ ǎ. "
Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God. ,Yě mɛ e ɖo hwɛhuhu sín ninɔmɛ e yě ɖǒ ɔ́ sín acɛ mɛ lɛ́ɛ sixú wa nǔ bɔ é ná hun xomɛ nú Mawu ǎ. 
"You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. ","Amɔ̌, midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mi sɔ́ nɔ zán gbɛ mitɔn lě e hwɛhuhu sín ninɔmɛ e mi ɖó ɔ́ zɔ́n gbɔn é ǎ; lě e Yɛsinsɛn jló gbɔn ɔ́ wɛ mi nɔ zán gbɛ mitɔn gbɔn; ényí Yɛ Mawu tɔn ɖo mi mɛ nǔgbó ɔ́ nɛ́. Mɛ ɖé ma ɖó Yɛ Klísu tɔn ǎ ɔ́, mɛ ɔ́ nyí Klísu tɔn ǎ. "
"But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness. ","Ényí Klísu ɖo mi mɛ ɔ́, agbaza mitɔn ɖo te nú kú, ɖó hwɛhuhu wútu; có Yɛ ɔ́ nyí gbɛ ɖo mi mɛ ɖó Mawu zé mi dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ ná. "
"And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you. ","Ényí Mawu e fɔ́n Jezu sín kú ɔ́ sín Yɛ ɖo mi mɛ ɔ́, mɛ e fɔ́n Klísu Jezu sín kú ɔ́ ná ná gbɛ agbaza mitɔn e ɖo te nú kú ɔ́ lɔmɔ̌ gbɔn Yɛ tɔn e ɖo mi mɛ é jí. "
"Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation–but it is not to the sinful nature, to live according to it. ","Nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi! Ényí mɔ̌ hǔn, azɔ̌ ɖo te nú mi; é ka nyí hwɛhuhu sín ninɔmɛ e mǐ ɖó ɔ́ na wa azɔ̌ ná wɛ mǐ ɖe, bó ná zán gbɛ mǐtɔn lě e é jló mǐ gbɔn é ǎ. "
"For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live, ","Đó ényí mi nɔ zán gbɛ mitɔn lě e hwɛhuhu sín ninɔmɛ e mi ɖo ɔ́ nɔ jló gbɔn ɔ́, mi ná kú. Lo ɔ́, ényí mi gbɔn Yɛsinsɛn jí bó hu walɔ agbaza tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mi ná nɔ gbɛ. "
because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. ,Mɛ e Yɛ Mawu tɔn nɔ́ xlɛ́ ali lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ nyí Mawu ví. 
"For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry, “Abba, Father.” ","Đó Yɛ e Mawu na mi ɔ́ nyí, yɛ e na sɔ́ mi dó ɖó kannumɔ, bó ná bló bɔ mi na húzú xɛsinɔ é ǎ. Lo ɔ́, Yɛsinsɛn e sɔ́ mi dó húzú Mawu ví, bó lɛ́ ná acɛ mǐ, bɔ mi nɔ sú xó ylɔ́ Mawu ɖɔ: “Daá ce! Tɔ́ ce vívɛ́ná” ɔ́ wɛ. "
The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children. ,Yɛ Mawu tɔn ɖésú ko yí gbe dó nǔ e yɛ mǐtɔn ɖɔ ɔ́ jí ɖɔ mǐ nyǐ Mawu ví. 
"Now if we are children, then we are heirs–heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory. ","Ée é nyí ɖɔ vǐ tɔn wɛ mǐ nyí é ɔ́, mǐ ná ɖó mǐmá ɖo ɖagbe e é sɔ́ ɖ'ayǐ nú togun tɔn ɔ́ mɛ, bó ná lɛ́ ɖó ɖagbe énɛ́ xá Klísu. Đó ényí mǐ ji ya xá Klísu ɔ́, mǐ ná lɛ́ ɖó mǐmá ɖo susu tɔn mɛ. "
I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. ,"Un mɔ ɖɔ nǔ e ɖo mǐ gbo wɛ ɖo hwenu e mǐ ɖe din ɔ́, è kún sixú jlɛ́ dó susu e Mawu ná wá ɖe xlɛ́ mǐ ɔ́ wú ó. "
The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. ,"Nǔ e è blǒ lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ ɖo te, bó ɖó jló ɖaxó, bó ná mɔ hwenu e Mawu ná ɖe vǐ tɔn lɛ́ɛ xlɛ́ dó é. "
"For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope ","Nǔ e è blǒ lɛ́ɛ jɛ nǔ e ma nɔ kplá mɛ yi fí ɖé ǎ ɔ́ sín acɛ mɛ; é ka nyí yě ɖésúnɔ wɛ jló, bó jɛ acɛ tɔn mɛ ǎ; Mawu wɛ sɔ́ yě ɖó acɛ tɔn mɛ; é ɖo mɔ̌ có nukúnɖíɖó ɖé ka tíin. "
that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. ,"Đó è nǎ ɖe yě sín acɛ nǔhɛngblétɔ́ e hɛn yě dó hɛn gantɔ́ ná ɔ́ tɔn mɛ gbe ɖokpó, bɔ yě ná ɖó mǐmá ɖo mɛɖée sí jijɛ susunɔ e Mawu ví lɛ́ɛ ɖó ɔ́ mɛ. "
We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. ,"Nǔgbó ɔ́, mǐ tunwun ɖɔ káká jɛ din ɔ́, nǔ e è blǒ lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ ɖo azɔn wɛn wɛ, bó ɖo wǔvɛ́ mɔ wɛ nyɔ̌nu ɖo ajidonu ɖɔhun. "
"Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. ","Lo ɔ́, é nyí nǔ e è blǒ lɛ́ɛ kɛ́ɖɛ́ wɛ ɖo azɔn wɛn wɛ ǎ, mǐ mɛ e ko ɖó Yɛsinsɛn, bɔ é nyí nǔ nukɔntɔn e Mawu ná mǐ, ɖo nǔníná tɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɔ́, mǐ lɔ ɖo azɔn wɛn wɛ ɖo ayi mɛ, lobo ɖo te kpɔ́n ɖɔ Mawu ní ɖe mǐ sín agbaza mǐtɔn mɛ, bó ná ɖɔ mǐ nyí vǐ émítɔn, lobo hwlɛ́n mǐ gan bǐ dégbédégbé. "
For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has? ,"Đó è ko hwlɛ́n mǐ gán; lo ɔ́, mǐ ɖo nukún ɖó wɛ ɖɔ è ní hwlɛ́n mǐ gán bǐ dégbédégbé. Ényí è ɖo nǔ e ɖó nukún wɛ è ɖe ɔ́ mɔ wɛ ɔ́, hǔn é sɔ́ nyí nukúnɖíɖó ǎ; mɛ̌ ka ná lɛ́ kpo ɖo nukún ɖó nǔ e mɔ wɛ é ɖe ɔ́ wɛ? "
"But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently. ","Ényí mǐ ɖo nukún ɖó nǔ e mɔ wɛ mǐ ma ɖe ǎ ɔ́ wɛ ɔ́, mǐ ɖo te kpɔ́n kpódó sɔxwixwe kpó. "
"In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express. ","Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, Yɛsinsɛn lɔ nɔ gɔ́ alɔ nú mǐ ɖo gǎnmaɖó mǐtɔn mɛ, ɖó mǐ nyɔ́ ɖɛ xo lě e é jɛ xá gbɔn é ǎ; lo ɔ́, Yɛ ɔ́ ɖésú nɔ xo ɖɛ dó ta mǐtɔn mɛ kpódó azɔnwinwɛn e è ma sixú ɖɔ ǎ é kpó. "
"And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will. ","Bɔ Mawu e nɔ mɔ nukúnnú jɛ ayi mɛ ɔ́ mɔ nukúnnú jɛ nǔ e Yɛsinsɛn jló ná byɔ́ ɔ́ wú, ɖó Yɛ nɔ xo ɖɛ lě e Mawu jló gbɔn ɔ́ nú mɛ e nyí Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ é. "
"And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. ","Mǐ tunwun ɖɔ mɛ e yí wǎn nú Mawu lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mɛ e é ylɔ́ ɖo tito tɔn mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, nǔ e nɔ jɛ dó yě jǐ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɔ́, ɖagbe wɛ é nɔ dó wá nú yě. "
"For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. ","Đó mɛ e Mawu ko tunwun sín do lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, é lɛ́ ɖɔ ɖ'ayǐ ɖɔ émí na bló bɔ yě ná cí Vǐ émítɔn ɖɔhun, bónú vǐ tɔn ná nyí nukɔn ví ɖo nɔví gěgé tɛ́ntin. "
"And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified. ","Mɛ e Mawu ɖe gbeta énɛ́ tɔ́n ɖ'ayǐ ná lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, é lɛ́ ylɔ́ yě; mɛ e é ylɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, é sɔ́ yě dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ; mɛ e é sɔ́ dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, é lɛ́ bló bɔ yě ɖó mǐmá ɖo susu tɔn mɛ. "
"What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? ","Đo nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ mɛ ɔ́, étɛ́ mǐ ka na lɛ́ ɖɔ? Ényí Mawu ɖo mǐ jí ɔ́, mɛ ɖěbǔ sixú wa nǔ ɖěbǔ nú mǐ ǎ. "
"He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all–how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? ","Éyɛ́ mɛ e ma hwlɛ́n Vǐ é ɖésúnɔ tɔn ǎ, bó sɔ́ ɛ jó dó mǐ bǐ tamɛ ɔ́, nɛ̌ é ma ka ná ná nǔ bǐ mǐ kpó Vǐ tɔn kpó ǎ gbɔn? "
Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. ,"Mɛ̌ ka ná dó hwɛ mɛ e Mawu cyán lɛ́ɛ? Mɛ ɖé ɖe ǎ, ɖó Mawu wɛ ɖɔ yě nyǐ hwɛjijɔnɔ. "
"Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died–more than that, who was raised to life–is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. ","Mɛ̌ ka ná ɖó hwɛ nú yě lo? Mɛ ɖé ɖe ǎ, ɖó Klísu Jezu wɛ nyí mɛ e kú é; nǔ e hú gǎn mɔ̌ ɔ́ wɛ nyí é fɔ́n sín kú, bó ɖo tɛn ɖaxó mɛ ɖo ɖisíxwé nú Mawu, bó ɖo vo sa nú Mawu wɛ dó ta mǐtɔn mɛ. "
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? ,"Étɛ́ ka sixú ɖe mǐ ɖó vo nú wǎn yíyí e Klísu ɖó nú mǐ é? Wǔvɛ́mimɔ wɛ a, nukúnmyámɛ wɛ a, yadónúmɛ wɛ a, xovɛ́ wɛ a, avɔvúnmɛ wɛ a, afɔkú wɛ a, kúdán wɛ a? "
As it is written: “For your sake we face death all day long,Fon
"No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. ","Lo ɔ́, nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɖo jijɛ wɛ, có Klísu e yí wǎn nú mǐ ɔ́ dó alɔ mǐ, bɔ mǐ ɖó ɖuɖéjí bǐ gbídígbídí. "
"For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, ","Đó un ɖeji ɖɔ nǔ ɖěbǔ kún sixú ɖe mǐ ɖó vo nú wǎn yíyí tɔn ó: mǐ ɖo gbɛ oo, mǐ ɖo kú oo, nǔ ɖěbǔ sixú ɖe mǐ ɖó vo nú wǎn yíyí tɔn ǎ; wɛnsagun lɛ́ɛ, acɛkpikpa lɛ́ɛ, kpódó hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n e ɖo jǐxwé lɛ́ɛ ɖěbǔ kpó sixú ɖe mǐ ɖó vo nú wǎn yíyí tɔn ǎ; mɔ̌ jɛ́n nǔ e ɖo jijɛ wɛ égbé lɛ́ɛ, kpódó éé ná wá jɛ sɔ lɛ́ɛ é kpán ma sixú ɖe mǐ ɖó vo nú wǎn yíyí tɔn ǎ é nɛ́. "
"neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.I speak the truth in Christ–I am not lying, my conscience confirms it in the Holy Spirit– ","Nǔ e ɖo hwe glɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpó nǔ e ɖo ayǐkúngban glɔ́ lɛ́ɛ é kpó, kpódó nǔ ɖěvo e è blǒ é ɖěbǔ kpán sixú ɖe mǐ ɖó vo nú wǎn yíyí e Mawu ɖe xlɛ́ mǐ gbɔn Aklúnɔ mǐtɔn Klísu Jezu jí é ǎ.Nǔgbó ɖɔ wɛ un ɖe, ɖo bǔ e un ɖe xá Klísu ɔ́ mɛ; un nɔ ɖó adingban ǎ.

I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. ,Un ɖo aluwɛ ɖaxó mɛ

It is not as though God's word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. ,Ényí akpá e Mawu dó ɔ́ gɔn azɔ̌ wa ɖɔ wɛ un ɖe ǎ. Đó é nyí mɛ e Izlayɛ́li ji lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ nyí togun Izlayɛ́li tɔn nǔgbó ɔ́ ǎ. 
"Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham's children. On the contrary, “It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.” ","Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, vǐ e Ablaxámu ji lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ nyí vǐ titewungbe n'i ǎ; ɖó Mawu ɖɔ nú Ablaxámu ɖɔ: “Izáki jí wɛ a nǎ ɖó vǐ e sín akpá un dó nú we lɛ́ɛ gbɔn.” "
"In other words, it is not the natural children who are God's children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham's offspring. ","É ɖo nyǐnyí wɛ ɖɔ é kún nyí vǐ e Ablaxámu ji lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ nyí Mawu ví ó; lo ɔ́, vǐ e sín akpá Mawu dó bɔ è ji lɛ́ɛ wɛ Mawu nɔ mɔ dó mɔ vǐ nǔgbó nǔgbó. "
"For this was how the promise was stated: “At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.” ","Đó Mawu dó akpá, bó ɖɔ: “Ényí hwenu e un ɖó ɔ́ su ɔ́, un ná lɛ́ wá, bɔ Sala ná ɖó vǐ súnnu ɖokpó.” "
"Not only that, but Rebekah's children had one and the same father, our father Isaac. ","Bǐ ká kó nɛ́ ǎ. Hlebeka ví we lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, tɔ́ ɖokpó ɔ́ wɛ ji yě; é wɛ nyí tɔ́gbó mǐtɔn Izáki. "
"Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad–in order that God's purpose in election might stand: ","Amɔ̌, Mawu ɖó tito tɔn, bó ná dó cyán gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ná: é ɖésú wɛ nɔ́ jló bó nɔ́ cyán mɛ; é nyí nǔwiwa mɛtɔn wɛ é nɔ́ kpɔ́n ǎ.

"Just as it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.” ","Lě e Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ gbɔn ɔ́: “Un yí wǎn nú Jakɔ́bu; lo ɔ́, un gbɛ́ wǎn nú Esawu.” "
What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all! ,"Étɛ́ mǐ ka ná ɖɔ lo? Mawu ɔ́, hwɛ agɔdótɔ́ wɛ é nyí a? Gbeɖé kpɔ́n. "
"For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.” ","Đó é ɖɔ nú Mɔyízi ɖɔ: “Un ná kú nǔbláwǔ nú mɛ e un jló ná kú nǔbláwǔ na é, bó ná nyɔ́ xomɛ dó mɛ e wú un jló na nyɔ́ xomɛ dó é.” "
"It does not, therefore, depend on man's desire or effort, but on God's mercy. ","Hǔn, é nyí jló gbɛtɔ́ tɔn wɛ na zɔ́n bɔ Mawu ná kú nǔbláwǔ nú mɛ abǐ é ná nyɔ́ xomɛ dó mɛ wú ǎ; é ka nyí gǎndídó gbɛtɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ wú wɛ ǎ. Lo ɔ́, Mawu e nɔ kú nǔbláwǔ nú mɛ ɔ́ wɛ. "
"For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.” ","Mawu ɖɔ nú axɔ́sú Ejípu tɔn ɖo Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ɖɔ: “Nǔ e wú un sɔ́ we axɔ́sú tawun lɛ́ɛ wɛ nyí ɖɔ un ná ɖe hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n ce xlɛ́ gbɔn jǐ towe; un sɔ́ we axɔ́sú, bónú nyǐkɔ ce ná gba kpé ayǐkúngban ɔ́ bǐ jǐ.” "
"Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, Mawu nɔ kú nǔbláwǔ nú mɛ e jló e ɔ́, bó nɔ bló bɔ mɛ e é jló ɖɔ é ní tlí tó ɔ́ nɔ húzú tótlítɔ́. "

"
"For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge. ","Đó un hɛn ɔ́, un ná ɖe kúnnu nú yě ɖɔ nǔ wa bó nyɔ́ ɖo Mawu sí sín akpakpa ɖaxó ɖé ɖo yě jí; lo ɔ́, yě ɖǒ nukúnnú-mɔjɛnǔmɛ titewungbe ɔ́ ǎ. "
"Since they did not know the righteousness that comes from God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, yě mɔ nukúnnú jɛ lě e Mawu nɔ sɔ́ gbɛtɔ́ dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ gbɔn ɔ́ wú ǎ, bó ba ali yě ɖésúnɔ tɔn, bó ná dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ ɖo Mawu nukɔn; énɛ́ ɔ́, yě sɔ́ gbɔn ali e Mawu ɖe bɔ gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ná gbɔn, bɔ Mawu ná sɔ́ yě dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ ná é ǎ. "
Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes. ,"Đó Klísu wɛ nyí mɛ e gɔ́n Mɔyízisɛ́n ɔ́ kplá mǐ xwe é, bónú Mawu ná sɔ́ mɛ e ɖi nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ. "
Moses describes in this way the righteousness that is by the law: “The man who does these things will live by them.” ,Mɔyízi wlán ɖɔ: “Mɛ e nɔ wa nǔ jlɔ́jlɔ́ lě e sɛ́n ɔ́ zɔ́n gbɔn ɔ́ ná mɔ gbɛ gbɔn sɛ́n ɔ́ jí.” 
"But the righteousness that is by faith says: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ down) ","Lo ɔ́, xó e è ɖɔ dó lě e Mawu nɔ sɔ́ gbɛtɔ́ dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ ná gbɔn ɖo é ɖésúnɔ nukɔn, gbɔn nǔɖiɖi gbla mɛ gbɔn ɔ́ ɖíe: “Ma ɖɔ dó ayi mɛ ɖɔ: ‘Mɛ̌ ka ná yi jǐxwé?’ (Bó ná ɖe Klísu jɛ te ó.) "
"“or ‘Who will descend into the deep?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). ",Ma ka lɛ́ ɖɔ dó ayi mɛ ɖɔ: ‘Mɛ̌ ka ná yi kútomɛ?’ (Bó ná fɔ́n Klísu sín kú) ó.” 
"But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,” that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming: ","Bɔ nɛ̌ è ka ɖɔ lo? Nǔ e è ɖɔ ɔ́ ɖíe: “Xó ɔ́ ɖo akpá towe; é ɖo nu towe mɛ, bó ɖo ayi towe mɛ.” Xó énɛ́ wɛ nyí nǔɖiɖi sín wɛn e jlá wɛ mǐ ɖe é. "
"That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. ","Đó ényí a sɔ́ nu towe dó ɖɔ ná ɖo mɛ bǐ nukɔn ɖɔ Jezu wɛ nyí Aklúnɔ lobo ɖi nǔ ɖo ayi towe mɛ ɖɔ Mawu fɔ́n ɛ sín kú ɔ́, Mawu ná hwlɛ́n we gán. "
"For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. ","Đó, nú mɛɖé ɖi nǔ ɖo ayi tɔn mɛ ɔ́, é nɔ sín énɛ́ wú bɔ mɛ énɛ́ nɔ húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ ɖo Mawu nukɔn.

"As the Scripture says, “Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame.” ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Mɛɖěbǔ ɖi nǔ n'i ɔ́, é ná ɖu winnyá ǎ.” "
"For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile–the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, ","Đó vogbingbɔn ɖé ɖo mɛ e nyí Jwifu é kpódó mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ é kpo tɛ́ntin ǎ; yě bǐ wɛ ɖó Aklúnɔ ɖokpó ɔ́; Aklúnɔ e nɔ dó nú mɛ e nɔ xomlá ɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ, bɔ é nɔ túnflá é. "
"for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.” ","Đó lě e Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ gbɔn ɔ́: “Mɛɖěbǔ ylɔ́ Aklúnɔ sín nyǐkɔ ɔ́, mɛ ɔ́ ná gán.” "
"How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? ","Lo ɔ́, ényí mɛ lɛ́ɛ ma ɖi nǔ n'i ǎ ɔ́, nɛ̌ yě ka ná xomlá ɛ gbɔn? Ényí è ma ɖɔ xó tɔn bɔ yě se ǎ ɔ́, nɛ̌ yě ka ná ɖi nǔ n'i gbɔn? Ényí mɛɖé ma jlá xó tɔn ǎ ɔ́, nɛ̌ yě ka ná se xó tɔn gbɔn? "
"And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!” ","Ényí è ma sɛ́ mɛ dó xó tɔn jlá gbé ǎ ɔ́, nɛ̌ è ka ná mɔ Wɛn Ɖagbejlátɔ́ gbɔn? Lě e Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ gbɔn ɔ́ ɖíe: “È mɔ Wɛn Ɖagbejlátɔ́ lɛ́ɛ jǎwe ɔ́, é nɔ nyɔ́ kpɔ́n mɛ.” "
"But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our message?” ","Amɔ̌, mɛ bǐ yí gbe nú Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ ǎ. Nǔgbó ɔ́, Ezayíi ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ, mɛ̌ ka ɖi nǔ nú Mawuxó e mǐ ɖɔ é?” "
"Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, nǔ e se wɛ è ɖe ɔ́ mɛ wɛ nǔɖiɖi nɔ tɔ́n sín, bɔ nǔ e se wɛ è ɖe ɔ́ ka nyí Klísu sín xó e jlá wɛ è ɖe é. "
"But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did: “Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.” ","Lo ɔ́, un nɔ kanbyɔ́ ɖɔ: “Yě ka se Mawuxó ɔ́ ǎ wɛ a?” Ɛɛn, yě se ganjí. Đó Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Yě ɖɔ xó bɔ è se gbɔn ayǐkúngban ɔ́ bǐ jǐ, bɔ xó e yě ɖɔ ɔ́ yi káká fí e gbɛ ɔ́ kponu ɖó é.” "
"Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says, “I will make you envious by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding.” ","Un nɔ lɛ́ kanbyɔ́ ɖɔ: “Togun Izlayɛ́li tɔn ɔ́ ka mɔ nukúnnú jɛ wú ǎ wɛ a?” Bó ná dó ná xó énɛ́ ɔ́ sín sin ɔ́, nǔ e Mɔyízi ɖɔ ɔ́ ɖíe: “Un ná bló bɔ mi ná hwan wǔ dó akɔta e ma nyí akɔta nǔgbó nǔgbó ǎ é. Un ná bló bɔ akɔta e ma ɖó nǔnywɛ́ ǎ é ná dó xomɛsin xomɛ nú mi.” "
"And Isaiah boldly says, “I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me.” ","Ée Ezayíi ɖɔ ɔ́ hú mɔ̌; é ɖɔ: “Mɛ e ma ɖo biba mì wɛ ɖ'ayǐ ǎ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, yě mɔ mì. Un sɔ́ nyɛɖée xlɛ́ mɛ e ma ko nɔ kan mì byɔ́ ɖ'ayǐ ǎ lɛ́ɛ.” "
"But concerning Israel he says, “All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people.”I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. ","Lo ɔ́, nǔ e é ɖɔ dó Izlayɛ́li wú ɔ́ ɖíe: “Tɛgbɛ tɛgbɛ wɛ un nɔ dlɛ́n alɔ nú togun e nɔ vɛ́ tóli, togun e nɔ fɔ́n gǔ é.”Hǔn, un nɔ kanbyɔ́ ɖɔ: Mawu gbɛ̌ togun tɔn wɛ a? Gbeɖé kpɔ́n! Đó nyɛ ɖésúnɔ ɔ́, Izlayɛ́li ví wɛ un nyí; Ablaxámu kún mɛ wɛ un jɔ ɖe, ɖo akɔta Bɛnjamɛ́ɛ tɔn mɛ. "
"God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don't you know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah–how he appealed to God against Israel: ","Mawu gbɛ̌ togun tɔn e é ko tunwun sín do é ǎ; nǔ e Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ ɖo akpá e xwé Elíi jɛ Izlayɛ́li ví lɛ́ɛ sín hwɛ ɖo Mawu nukɔn ɖe ɔ́, mi ma tunwun a? "
"“Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me”? ","Elíi ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ, yě hu gbeyíɖɔ towe lɛ́ɛ; yě gba vɔ̌sákpe towe lɛ́ɛ; nyɛ ɖokpónɔ géé wɛ kpo, bɔ yě ka lɛ́ ɖo biba na hu mì wɛ.” "
And what was God's answer to him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.” ,Xó tɛ́ Mawu ka ɖɔ d'é wú n'i? Mawu ɖɔ: “Un sɔ́ gbɛtɔ́ děgba ɖě afɔwó-afatɔ́n (7.000) ɖ'ayǐ nú nyɛɖée
"So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. ","Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, hwenu e mǐ ɖe din ɔ́, é lɛ́ kpo mɛ e Mawu cyán ɖo xomɛnyínyɔ́ tɔn mɛ ɔ́ kpɛɖé. "
"And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace. ","Xomɛnyínyɔ́ tɔn wú wɛ é cyán yě; é nyí nǔ e yě wa lɛ́ɛ wú wɛ ǎ; é ma nyí mɔ̌ ǎ ɔ́, xomɛnyínyɔ́ Mawu tɔn sɔ́ na nyí xomɛnyínyɔ́ nǔgbó nǔgbó ǎ. "
"What then? What Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened, ","Hǔn, é ɖo wɛn: togun Izlayɛ́li tɔn mɔ nǔ e ba wɛ é ɖe ɔ́ yí ǎ. Mɛ e Mawu cyán ɖo togun ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ kɛ́ɖɛ́ wɛ mɔ yí; mɛ e kpo lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, é bló bɔ yě húzú tótlítɔ́. "
"as it is written: “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes so that they could not see and ears so that they could not hear, to this very day.” ","Lě e Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ gbɔn ɔ́: “Mawu bló bɔ káká jɛ égbé ɔ́, ayixa yětɔn sɔ́ nɔ mɔ nǔ ǎ; nukún yětɔn sɔ́ nɔ mɔ nǔ ǎ, tó yětɔn lɛ́ɛ sɔ́ nɔ se nǔ ǎ.” "
"And David says: “May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them. ","Davídi lɔ ɖɔ: “Nǔɖuɖu ɖagbe ɖagbe e yě ɖa ɔ́ ní nyí mɔ nú yě; é ní nyí ɖɔ, bónú yě ná jɛ mɛ, bónú è nǎ dɔn tó nú yě. "
"May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.” ","Nukún yětɔn ní dó zǐnflú, bónú yě ní ba nukúnnú kpo; blǒ bónú yě ní mɔ wǔvɛ́ káká nú kpó yětɔn ní xá.” "
"Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious. ","Hǔn, un nɔ kanbyɔ́ ɖɔ: “Hwenu e Jwifu lɛ́ɛ klɛ́n afɔ ɔ́, yě jɛ ayǐ bó nɔ mɔ̌ káká sɔ́yi wɛ a?” Gbeɖé kpɔ́n! Lo ɔ́, ɖó hwɛ e yě hu ɔ́ wútu ɔ́, togun ɖě lɛ́ɛ mɔ hwlɛngán, bónú Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ná sixú hwan wǔ dó yě. "
"But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring! ","Ényí hwɛ e Jwifu lɛ́ɛ hu ɔ́ dó dɔkun Yɛsinsɛn tɔn nú gbɛ ɔ́, ényí sɔ́ e è sɔ́ yě hwe ɔ́ dó dɔkun Yɛsinsɛn tɔn nú togun ɖě lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, nɛ̌ kɔ e yě bǐ sésé ná lɛ́ wá, bó mɔ hwlɛngán ɔ́ ma na wa azɔ̌ hú mɔ̌ ǎ gbɔn? "
"I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry ","Din ɔ́, mi mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ xó ná wɛ un ɖe: un nyí mɛsɛ́dó nú mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ; ée nǔ ka nyí mɔ̌ ɔ́, un nɔ gó ɖó azɔ̌ e nyí ce ɔ́ wú. "
in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them. ,"Afɔ nyɔ́ ɔ́, un sixú fɔ́n wǔhwinhwan dó jǐ nú mɛ e ɖo akɔta ce mɛ lɛ́ɛ; ényí un wa nǔ gbɔn mɔ̌ ɔ́, un sixú hwlɛ́n yě mɛ ɖěe gán. "
"For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, ée Mawu gbɛ́ mɛ e ɖo akɔta ce mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, é dó hwɛ gbɔ xá akɔta ɖě lɛ́ɛ e kpo ɖo gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ é. Hwenu e Mawu ka ná wá yí yě ɔ́, nɛ̌ é ná nyí gbɔn lo? Gbɛ wɛ é ná nyí nú mɛ e ko kú lɛ́ɛ. "
"If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches. ","Ényí è sɔ́ wɔ̌xúxú ɖé bó kán ɖ'é wu, bó sɔ́ xwlé Mawu ɔ́, wɔ̌xúxú e kpo ɔ́ bǐ wɛ nyí étɔn. Ényí è sɔ́ atín sín ɖɔ ɖó vo nú Mawu ɔ́, atínla lɛ́ɛ lɔ bǐ wɛ nyí Mawu tɔn. "
"If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, ","Togun Izlayɛ́li tɔn ɔ́ cí olívutín e è tun bó kpé nukún d'é wú, bɔ è jlǎ ala tɔn ɖé lɛ́ɛ ɔ́ ɖɔhun.

"do not boast over those branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you. ","Énɛ́ wútu ɔ́, a ɖǒ na gbɛ́ wǎn nú ala ɖě lɛ́ɛ ǎ. Nɛ̌ a ka sixú jlá ajɔ̌ nú hwiɖée gbɔn? Hwi wɛ hɛn ɖɔ lɛ́ɛ ǎ, lo ɔ́, ɖɔ lɛ́ɛ wɛ hɛn hwɛ. "
"You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.” ","A nǎ ɖɔ nú mì ɖɔ: “Ala énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, gbo wɛ è gbo yě síin, bó ná sɔ́ mì cá dó nu yětɔn.” "
"Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid. ","Nǔgbó wɛ é nyí. È gbo yě síin ɖó nǔmaɖi yětɔn wútu, bɔ a ɖo tɛn énɛ́ mɛ, ɖó nǔ e a ɖi ɔ́ wú. Hǔn ma yí go ó, lo ɔ́, ɖi xɛsi. "
"For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either. ","Đó ényí Mawu ma jó Jwifu e nyí ala e jɔ kpó atín ɔ́ kpó lɛ́ɛ nyi tɛn yětɔn mɛ ǎ ɔ́, é ná jó hwi lɔ dó ǎ. "
"Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off. ","Kpɔ́n lě e Mawu ɖe xomɛnyínyɔ́ tɔn kpó hunnylánylá tɔn kpó xlɛ́ gbɔn é: é nɔ́ nylá hun dó mɛ e hu hwɛ lɛ́ɛ, bó ka nyɔ́ xomɛ dó wú we; lo ɔ́, a ɖǒ ná nɔ xomɛnyínyɔ́ tɔn mɛ; é ma nyí mɔ̌ ǎ ɔ́, é ná gbo hwi lɔ síin atínla ɖɔhun. "
"And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. ","Ényí Jwifu lɛ́ɛ lɛ́ kɔ sín nǔmaɖi yětɔn gúdo ɔ́, Mawu ná cá yě dó fí e yě ko ɖe ɖ'ayǐ é; ɖó é ɖó acɛ bó ná lɛ́ vɔ́ yě cá. "
"After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree! ","Hwi mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ ɔ́, ala e jɔ kpó olívutín gbě tɔn kpó ɔ́ wɛ a nyǐ: è gbo ala ɔ́ síin, bó sɔ́ ɛ cá dó olívutín e è tun bo kpé nukún d'é wú ɔ́ wú, có mɔ̌ wɛ nǔ ka nɔ́ nyí gbɔn ɖo gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ ǎ.

"I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in. ","Nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, nǔbúdo ɖokpó ɖíe, bɔ un jló ná ɖe xlɛ́ mi, bónú mi ma sɔ́ miɖée dó mɔ nǔnywɛ́tɔ́ ná ó: togun Izlayɛ́li tɔn akpá bǔ húzú tótlítɔ́.

"And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: “The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob. ",Mɔ̌ wɛ Mawu ná hwlɛ́n Izlayɛ́li ví lɛ́ɛ bǐ gán gbɔn

"As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies on your account; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs, ","Ényí è kpɔ́n lě e Jwifu lɛ́ɛ gbɛ́ Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ gbɔn ɔ́, kɛntɔ́ Mawu tɔn wɛ yě nyí bɔ é húzú ɖagbe nú mi; lo ɔ́, nú è kpɔ́n lě e Mawu sɔ́ yě gbɔn ɔ́, yě wɛ Mawu yí wǎn ná ɖó akpá e é dó nú tɔ́gbó yětɔn lɛ́ɛ wútu.

"You, then, why do you judge your brother? Or why do you look down on your brother? For we will all stand before God's judgment seat. ","Amɔ̌, hwɛ ɔ́, étɛ́wú a ɖo hwɛ dó nɔví towe wɛ? Hwɛ lo, étɛ́wú a gbɛ̌ wǎn nú nɔví towe? "

"As one who is in the Lord Jesus, I am fully convinced that no food is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean.

Do not allow what you consider good to be spoken of as evil. ,Nǔ e nyɔ́ nú mi ɔ́ ɖó ná nyí nǔ e wú mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ ná ɖɔ xó nyanya dó é ǎ. 
"For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, ","Đó axɔ́súɖuɖu Mawu tɔn nyí nǔɖuɖu kpó ahan kpó sín xó ɖé ǎ; hwɛjijɔ kpódó fífá kpó, kpódó awǎjijɛ e Yɛsinsɛn nɔ ná mɛ ɔ́ kpó sín xó wɛ. "
because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by men. ,"Mɛ e nɔ wa azɔ̌ nú Klísu gbɔn mɔ̌ ɔ́, nǔ tɔn nɔ nyɔ́ Mawu nukún mɛ; gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ nɔ kpa ɛ. "
Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification. ,"Hǔn, mǐ ní bó ba nǔ e nɔ dɔn fífá wá, bó ná zɔ́n bɔ mǐ ná dó wǔsyɛ́n lanmɛ nú miɖée ɖo nǔɖiɖi mɛ é. "
"Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. ","Ma hɛn Mawuzɔ́ ɔ́ gblé ɖó nǔɖuɖu wútu ó. Nǔgbó ɔ́, è sixú ɖu nǔ bǐ. Nú è nǎ ɖu nǔɖé, bónú nɔví mɛtɔn ná jɛ hwɛ mɛ ɔ́, é nyɔ́ nú è nǐ gɔn ɖuɖu. "
It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall. ,"Nǔ e nyɔ́ ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ, è nǐ jó nǔ e ná zɔ́n bɔ nɔví mɛtɔn ná jɛ hwɛ mɛ ɔ́ bǐ dó; ényí lan wɛ hǔn, ma ɖu ó; ényí vɛ̌ɛn wɛ hǔn, ma nu ó; ényí nǔ ɖěbǔ wɛ hǔn, ma bló ó. "
So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself by what he approves. ,Hɛn nǔɖiɖi e hwi ɖésúnɔ ɖó dó nǔ énɛ́ wú ɔ́ nú hwiɖée ɖo Mawu nukɔn. Nǔ nyɔ́ nú mɛ e wa nǔ e é mɔ ɖɔ é nyɔ́ bɔ ayi tɔn ma xo hun xá ɛ ǎ é. 
"But the man who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves. ","Lo ɔ́, mɛ e xo nǔ kpɔ́n dó nǔɖuɖu ɖé wú, cóbó ka ɖu ɔ́, Mawu ɖó hwɛ nú mɛ énɛ́; ɖó é wa nǔ lě e nǔɖiɖi ɔ́ zɔ́n gbɔn é ǎ.

","gbɔn nǔjíjlɛ́ lɛ́ɛ kpódó nǔdábaɖa lɛ́ɛ kpó sín hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n mɛ; gbɔn Yɛsinsɛn sín hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n mɛ.

"It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else's foundation. ","Lo ɔ́, un tunwun ɖɔ fí e è ma ko se Klísuxó ɖe ǎ lɛ́ɛ kɛ́ɖɛ́ jɛ́n un ná jlá Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ gbɔn dandan, bónú é ní ma cí dǒ e mɛɖěvo dó do ɔ́ jí wɛ un mɛ xɔ nyi ɖɔhun ó. "
"Rather, as it is written: “Those who were not told about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand.” ","Lě e Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ gbɔn ɔ́: “Mɛ e è ma ko ɖɔ xó tɔn ná kpɔ́n ǎ lɛ́ɛ ná mɔ ɛ, bɔ mɛ e ma ko se xó tɔn kpɔn ǎ lɛ́ɛ ná mɔ nukúnnú jɛ wú.” "
This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you. ,"Azɔn nabí ɖé wɛ é sín Wɛn Ɖagbe jlájlá gbɔn fí e è ma ko se Klísuxó ɔ́ ɖe ǎ lɛ́ɛ é wú, bɔ un gɔn gɔ̌n mitɔn. "
"But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions, and since I have been longing for many years to see you, ","Amɔ̌, din ɔ́, un ko fó azɔ̌ ce ɖo gbě énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ jí. Gɔ̌n mitɔn wiwa ɖo jlǒjló mì wɛ din ɔ́, xwe tɔn ko sukpɔ́. "
"I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I hope to visit you while passing through and to have you assist me on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while. ","Un ka jló ɖɔ nú un xwe Ɛsipányi ɔ́, un ná wá gbɔn mi gɔ́n, bónú jló e un ɖó, bó ná nɔ mi gɔ́n ɔ́ jɛmɛ nú mì kpɛɖé ɔ́, mi ná d'alɔ mì bɔ un ná yi to énɛ́ mɛ. "
"Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the saints there. ","Amɔ̌, din ɔ́, un xwe Jeluzalɛ́mu, bó ná yi gɔ́ alɔ nú mɛɖeɖóvo Mawu tɔn e ɖo dɔ̌n lɛ́ɛ. "
For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem. ,"Nǔgbó ɔ́, klísusɛntɔ́ e ɖo Masedwani kpó Akáyi kpó lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ émí ná jɔ akwɛ́ nú wamamɔnɔ e ɖo mɛɖeɖóvo Mawu tɔn mɛ, ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu lɛ́ɛ. "
"They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews' spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings. ","Yě ɖésúnɔ wɛ bló kpó xomɛhunhun kpó; lo ɔ́, è nǎ ɖɔ nǔgbó ɔ́, axɔ́ wɛ é nyí bɔ yě ɖu dó wamamɔnɔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ.

"So after I have completed this task and have made sure that they have received this fruit, I will go to Spain and visit you on the way. ","Ényí un ko ɖɔ xó énɛ́ gbo, bó ko sɔ́ nǔ e è jɔ lɛ́ɛ jó nú yě ɔ́, un ná ɖidó Ɛsipányi; un ka xweyǐgbe ɔ́, un ná gbɔn mi gɔ́n. "
"I know that when I come to you, I will come in the full measure of the blessing of Christ. ","Un ka tunwun ɖɔ un jǎwe mi gɔn ɔ́, un ná hɛn nyɔ̌ná kpíkpé Klísu tɔn wá nú mi. "
"I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me. ","Nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, nǔ e wú un ɖo vo sa nú mi wɛ gbɔn Aklúnɔ mǐtɔn Jezu Klísu kpó wǎn yíyí e Yɛsinsɛn nɔ ná mɛ ɔ́ kpán jí ɔ́ ɖíe: mi fun ahwan e fun wɛ un ɖe ɔ́ xá mì, bó sa vo nú Mawu dó ta ce mɛ. "
"Pray that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea and that my service in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints there, ","Mi xo ɖɛ bónú ma gló nǔmaɖitɔ́ e ɖo Judée lɛ́ɛ, bónú alɔgɔ́númɛ sín azɔ̌ e wú un xwe Jeluzalɛ́mu ɔ́, mɛɖeɖóvo Mawu tɔn e ɖo dɔ̌n lɛ́ɛ ní kɛ alɔ bó yí. "
so that by God's will I may come to you with joy and together with you be refreshed. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, nú é jló Mawu ɔ́, un ná wá mi gɔ́n kpó awǎjijɛ ɖaxó kpó, bó ná gbɔjɛ́ ɖo tɛ́ntin mitɔn. "

"What I mean is this: One of you says, “I follow Paul”; another, “I follow Apollos”; another, “I follow Cephas ”; still another, “I follow Christ.” ","Nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ un ɖe bó ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́ ɖíe: mi ɖokpó ɖokpó nɔ́ ɖo xó vovo ɖɔ wɛ; mɛ ɖě nɔ ɖɔ: “Nyɛ ɔ́, Pɔ́lu tɔn wɛ un nyí”; mɛɖěvo nɔ ɖɔ: “Nyɛ ɔ́, Apolosu tɔn wɛ un nyí”; mɛɖěvo nɔ lɛ́ ɖɔ: “Nyɛ ɔ́, Sefási tɔn wɛ un nyí”; bɔ mɛ ɖě nɔ lɛ́ ɖɔ: “Nyɛ ɔ́, Klísu tɔn wɛ un nyí.” "

"For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel–not with words of human wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power. ","Klísu sɛ́ mì dó nú má wá lɛ yɛhwesin nú mɛ ǎ; Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ wɛ é sɛ́ mì dó ɖɔ má wá jlá; nyɛ ní má ka zé nǔnywɛ́ gbɛtɔ́ tɔn sín xó dó jlá ná ó; é má nyí mɔ̌ ǎ ɔ́, hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n e kú e Klísu kú ɖo aklúzu jí ɔ́ ɖó ɔ́ táá nyí nǔ yǎyá.

"For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.

For it is written: “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,Fon
Where is the wise man? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? ,"Ényí nǔ nyí mɔ̌ ɔ́, ani wɛ nǔnywɛ́tɔ́, abǐ wěmasetɔ́, abǐ xóɖɔdóxówútɔ́ gbɛmɛ fí tɔn lɛ́ɛ sɔ́ sixú lɛ́ ɖɔ?

"For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, gbɔn nǔnywɛ́ e gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖó ɔ́ gbla mɛ ɔ́, yě kpé wú bó tunwun Mawu ɖo fí e nǔnywɛ́ tɔn ɖo azɔ̌ wa ɖe wɛ ɔ́ ǎ.

"For the foolishness of God is wiser than man's wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man's strength. ","Đó nǔ e è nɔ mɔ dó mɔ xlojijɔ Mawu tɔn ná ɔ́, nǔnywɛ́ e ɖ'é mɛ ɔ́ hú gǎn nǔnywɛ́ e gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖó é; nǔ e è nɔ mɔ dó mɔ vǐvɔ́ Mawu tɔn ná ɔ́, hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n e é ɖó ɔ́ hú gǎn ée gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖó é. "
"Brothers, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth.

But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise,Fon
"He chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things–and the things that are not–to nullify the things that are, ","Nǔ e gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ mɔ dó mɔ nǔ masɔatɛ́n, nǔ gbɛ́hɛn, nǔ yǎyá ɔ́, Mawu sɔ́ dó gba nǔ e yě sɔ́ dó mɔ nǔgɛ́n é. "
so that no one may boast before him. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, gbɛtɔ́ ɖěbǔ sixú yí go ɖo Mawu nukɔn ǎ. "
"It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God–that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption.

"Therefore, as it is written: “Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.”When I came to you, brothers, I did not come with eloquence or superior wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, lě e Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ gbɔn ɔ́: “Nú mɛɖé jló ná jlá ajɔ̌ nú éɖée ɔ́, ní jlá ɖó Aklúnɔ ɔ́ wú.”Nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, hwenu e un wá mi gɔ́n bó ná ɖɔ nǔbúdo Mawu tɔn ɔ́ sín xó nú mi ɔ́, un zán xógbe gɛ́dɛ́gɛ́dɛ́, abǐ nǔnywɛ́ xwítíxwítí ɖé dó ɖɔ xó nú mi ǎ. "
For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. ,"Đó un ko ɖɔ ɖɔ hwenu e un ná nɔ mi gɔ́n xɔ ɔ́ bǐ sésé ɔ́, un kún sɔ́ ná tunwun nǔ ɖěbǔ zɛ Jezu Klísu wú ó; ɖo tají ɔ́, Jezu Klísu e è ká nyi aklúzu jí é. "
"I came to you in weakness and fear, and with much trembling. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ un wá mi gɔ́n, gǎn ɖé ma ɖó, kpó xɛsi kpó, kpódó sísɔ́sísɔ́ kpán. "
"My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power, ","É nyí nǔnywɛ́ gbɛtɔ́ tɔn sín xó víví lɛ́ɛ wɛ un sɔ́ dó kplɔ́n nǔ mɛ ǎ, é ka nyí é wɛ un dó ɖɔ Mawuxó ɔ́ ná ǎ; lo ɔ́, Yɛ Mawu tɔn sín hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n sín nǔwiwa wɛ. "
"so that your faith might not rest on men's wisdom, but on God's power. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, nǔɖiɖi mitɔn jínjɔ́n nǔnywɛ́ gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ tɔn jí ǎ; lo ɔ́ hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n Mawu tɔn jí wɛ é jínjɔ́n. "
"We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing. ","É ɖo mɔ̌ có, un ɖo nǔnywɛ́ ɖé kplɔ́n klísusɛntɔ́ e ko zin ɖo nǔɖiɖi mɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ; amɔ̌ nǔnywɛ́ énɛ́ nyí nǔnywɛ́ gbɛmɛ fí tɔn ǎ; é ka nyí hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n e ɖo acɛ kpa wɛ ɖo gbɛ élɔ́ mɛ, bɔ è ka ná wá hu acɛ ná lɛ́ɛ ǎ. "
"No, we speak of God's secret wisdom, a wisdom that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began. ","Éeǒ! Nǔnywɛ́ énɛ́ jlá wɛ un ɖe ǎ. Nǔnywɛ́ Mawu tɔn e nyí nǔbúdo bɔ Mawu zé hwlá dó gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ é jlá wɛ un ɖe; nǔnywɛ́ énɛ́ wɛ Mawu ko sɔ́ ɖ'ayǐ xóxó nú susu mǐtɔn, cóbɔ gbɛ ɔ́ wá tíin. "
"None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. ","Hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n gbɛ élɔ́ mɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖěbǔ kó tunwun nǔnywɛ́ énɛ́ ɖ'ayǐ ǎ; ényí ɖɔ yě kó tunwun wɛ ɔ́, yě ná zɔ́n ɖɔ è nǐ ká Aklúnɔ susunɔ ɔ́ nyi aklúzu jí ǎ. "
"However, as it is written: “No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him” – ","Lo ɔ́, lě e Mawuxówéma ɔ́ kó ɖɔ gbɔn ɔ́: “Nǔ e mɛ ɖěbǔ ma mɔ kpɔ́n gbeɖé, bó ma ka se kpɔ́n gbeɖé ǎ ɔ́, nǔ e mɛ ɖěbǔ ma lin kpɔ́n gbeɖé ǎ ɔ́, Mawu bló nǔ énɛ́ ɖ'ayǐ nú mɛ e yí wǎn n'i lɛ́ɛ.” "
"but God has revealed it to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. ","Mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ ka nyí mɛ e Mawu ɖe nǔbúdo énɛ́ xlɛ́ gbɔn Yɛsinsɛn jí é. Nǔgbó ɔ́, Yɛsinsɛn ɔ́ nɔ ba do nú nǔ bǐ káká jɛ tito Mawu tɔn e ɖo hwlǎhwlá ɖo gɔngɔn mɛ lɛ́ɛ é lɔ jí. "
For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit within him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. ,"Đo gbɛtɔ́ nyínyí sín alixo ɔ́, yɛ e ɖo gbɛtɔ́ mɛ ɔ́ jɛ́n tunwun nǔ e kunkplá gbɛtɔ́ é; mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, Yɛ Mawu tɔn kɛ́ɖɛ́ jɛ́n tunwun nǔ e kunkplá Mawu é. "
"We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us. ","Mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, ényí yɛ e ɖo gbɛ élɔ́ mɛ ɔ́ wɛ è nǎ mǐ ǎ; lo ɔ́, Mawu ná mǐ Yɛ e gosín gɔ̌n tɔn é, bónú mǐ ná tunwun nǔ e Mawu ná mǐ vɔ̌nu lɛ́ɛ bǐ, "
"This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words. ","bó nɔ́ ɖo xó tɔn ɖɔ wɛ.

"The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned. ","Mɛ e ma ɖó Yɛ Mawu tɔn ǎ ɔ́ sixú yí nǔníná Mawu tɔn e Yɛ énɛ́ ɔ́ nɔ ná mɛ lɛ́ɛ é ǎ; xlonɔxó wɛ é nɔ́ mɔ xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ dó mɔ ná; é sixú mɔ nukúnnú jɛ yě mɛ ǎ, ɖó Yɛ Mawu tɔn ɔ́ jɛ́n è sixú dó ba do nú nǔgbó Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ ná. "
"The spiritual man makes judgments about all things, but he himself is not subject to any man's judgment: ","Mɛ e ɖó Yɛ Mawu tɔn ɔ́ jɛ́n sixú ɖɔ hwɛ dó nǔ bǐ; lo ɔ́, mɛ ɖěbǔ sixú ɖɔ hwɛ dó éyɛ́ ǎ. "
"“For who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him?” But we have the mind of Christ.Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual but as worldly–mere infants in Christ. ","Ɖó Mawuxówéma ko ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌ ka tunwun Aklúnɔ sín linlin lɛ́ɛ?

"I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready. ","Anɔ̌sin wɛ un ná mi; é nyí nǔɖuɖu syɛ́nsyɛ́n wɛ ǎ, ɖó mi sixú kpé wú ǎ; bɔ káká jɛ égbé din ɔ́, mi tlɛ ko sixú kpé wú ǎ. "
"You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere men? ","Đó mi lɛ́ kpo ɖo gbɛ zán wɛ gbɛtɔ́ gbɛ élɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔhun.

"For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not mere men? ","Ée mɛ mitɔn ɖě nɔ ɖɔ: “Un nyí Pɔ́lu tɔn”, bɔ mɛɖěvo nɔ ɖɔ: “Un nyí Apolosu tɔn” ɔ́, nǔ wa wɛ mi ɖe gbɛtɔ́ kpaa lɛ́ɛ ɖɔhun nɛ́ ǎ cé? "
"What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe–as the Lord has assigned to each his task. ","Nǔ e un ná kanbyɔ́ mi ɔ́, mɛ̌ ka nyí Apolosu?

"I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow. ","Nyɛ wɛ tun atín ɔ́, bɔ Apolosu hú sin ná; Mawu wɛ ka ná bɔ é su. "
"So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow. ","Hǔn, mɛ e tun atín ɔ́, kpódó mɛ e hú sin ná ɔ́ kpán ɔ́, yě nyí nǔtí ǎ. Mawu wɛ nyí nǔ bǐ; ɖó é wɛ bló bɔ atín ɔ́ su. "
"The man who plants and the man who waters have one purpose, and each will be rewarded according to his own labor. ","Mɛ e tun atín é kpódó mɛ e hú sin ná é kpó ɔ́, zɛ̌nzɛ̌n wɛ yě ɖe; mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó ná mɔ lě e é wa nǔ gbɔn ɔ́ sín ajɔ yí ɖo Mawu sí. "
"For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's building. ","Đó azɔ̌ wa ɖó kpɔ́ wɛ mǐ ɖe nú Mawu, bɔ midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ka nyí gle Mawu tɔn, bó lɛ́ nyí xɔ Mawu tɔn. "
"By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should be careful how he builds. ","Un wa azɔ̌ ɖi xɔmɛtɔ́gán e nǔnywɛ́ kpé é ɖɔhun, bó dó xɔ ɔ́ do ganjí, lě e Mawu ná nǔníná tɔn mì gbɔn é. Din ɔ́, mɛɖěvo ɖo dǒ mɛ ɖ'é jí wɛ.

"For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. ","Đó è ko dó dǒ ɔ́ do; Jezu Klísu wɛ nyí dǒ dodó énɛ́ ɔ́, bɔ mɛ ɖěbǔ sɔ́ sixú dó dǒ ɖěvo do ǎ. "
"If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, ","Mɛ ɖé lɛ́ɛ ná sɔ́ siká abǐ kpatágan, abǐ awǐnnya xɔ akwɛ́ dó mɛ dǒ ɖó dǒ dodó ɔ́ jí; mɛɖěvo lɛ́ɛ ka ná zán atín, abǐ sɛ, abǐ gběhan. "
"his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man's work. ","Amɔ̌, Aklúnɔ sín azǎn ɔ́ wɛ ná ɖe lě e azɔ̌ mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó tɔn ɖe gbɔn é xlɛ́, bɔ é ná jɛ wěxo.

"If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward. ","Ényí azɔ̌ e mɛɖé wa ɖó dǒ dodó ɔ́ jí ɔ́ kpo ɖo te ɔ́, é ná mɔ ajɔ yí ɖo Mawu sí. "
"If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames. ","Ényí azɔ̌ mɛɖé tɔn ka fyɔ́ ɖo myɔ ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, mɛ énɛ́ ná mɔ ajɔ ɖěbǔ yí ɖo Mawu sí ǎ; é ɖo mɔ̌ có mɛ énɛ́ ɖésú ná mɔ hwlɛngán mɛ e xo myɔ ɔ́ zlɛ́, bó gán é ɖɔhun. "
Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit lives in you? ,"Mi tunwun ɖɔ sinsɛnxɔ Mawu tɔn wɛ émí nyí, bɔ Yɛ Mawu tɔn ɖo émí mɛ. "
"If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him; for God's temple is sacred, and you are that temple. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, ényí mɛɖé mu sinsɛnxɔ Mawu tɔn ɔ́, Mawu ná gblé gbɛ dó nú mɛ énɛ́; ɖó sinsɛnxɔ Mawu tɔn ɔ́, nǔ mímɛ́ wɛ é nyí; mi wɛ ka nyí sinsɛnxɔ tɔn. "
"Do not deceive yourselves. If any one of you thinks he is wise by the standards of this age, he should become a “fool” so that he may become wise. ","Mɛɖé bó ma blɛ́ éɖée ó. Ényí mɛɖé ɖo mi mɛ, bónú nǔ e gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ nǔnywɛ́ ɔ́ wɛ é ɖó, lobo ɖɔ émí ɖó nǔnywɛ́ ɔ́, mɛ énɛ́ ní bó húzú xlonɔ bó ná sixú ɖó nǔnywɛ́ titewungbe ɔ́. "
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight. As it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness” ,Fon
"and again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.” ",Mawuxówéma ɔ́ lɛ́ ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ tunwun ɖɔ linlin nǔnywɛ́tɔ́ lɛ́ɛ tɔn kún nyí nǔtí ó.” 
"So then, no more boasting about men! All things are yours, ",Hǔn mɛ ɖěbǔ ɖó ná tɛ afɔ ayǐ ɖó gbɛtɔ́ wú ǎ
"whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future–all are yours, ","Pɔ́lu oo, Apolosu abǐ Sefási oo, wɛ̌kɛ́ oo, gbɛ oo, kú oo, din abǐ sɔ e jǎwe ɔ́ oo, nǔ bǐ wɛ nyí mitɔn. "
"and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.So then, men ought to regard us as servants of Christ and as those entrusted with the secret things of God. ","Amɔ̌ midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, Klísu tɔn wɛ mi nyí, bɔ Klísu nyí Mawu tɔn.Hǔn, mi ɖó ná nɔ mɔ mǐ dó mɔ azɔ̌watɔ́ Klísu tɔn ná, bó ɖó ná mɔ mǐ dó mɔ mɛ e Mawu sɔ́ nǔbúdo tɔn lɛ́ɛ sín azɔ̌ dó así ná lɛ́ɛ é. "
Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful. ,"Mɛ e è zě azɔ̌ ɖé dó así ná ɔ́, nǔ e byɔ́ ɛ wɛ è ɖe kpowun ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ é ní nɔ gbejí. "
"I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself. ","Nyɛ ɔ́, ényí mi ɖɔ hwɛ xá mì, abǐ è ɖɔ hwɛ xá mì, ɖo hwɛɖɔxɔsá gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ tɔn ɔ́, énɛ́ ɔ́ vɛ́ nú mì ɖěbǔ ǎ; un ka ɖo hwɛ ɖɔ xá nyɛ ɖésúnɔ wɛ ǎ. "
"My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, ayixa ce xo hun xá mì ɖo nǔ ɖěbǔ mɛ ǎ; lo ɔ́, énɛ́ ɔ́ ko ɖe xlɛ́ ɖɔ un nyí xomɛvɔ́nɔ ǎ. Aklúnɔ wɛ nyí mɛ e nɔ ɖɔ hwɛ dó mì é. "
Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time,Fon
"Now, brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying, “Do not go beyond what is written.” Then you will not take pride in one man over against another. ","Nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ e un ɖɔ nú mi din ɔ́, Apolosu kpó nyɛ ɖésúnɔ kpó wú wɛ un ɖɔ xó dó, bó dó kplɔ́n nǔ mi, bónú mi ná kpɔ́n nǔ dó mǐ wú, bó ná tunwun nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ lǒ élɔ́ ɖe é: “Mi ma wa nǔ zɛ nǔ e è wlán ɔ́ wú ó.” Mɛ ɖé ma ɖo mi mɛ, bó sɔ́ mɛɖé dó xɔ susu ná, bó gbɛ́ wǎn nú mɛɖé ó. "
"For who makes you different from anyone else? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not? ","Đó mɛ̌ wɛ bló bɔ a hú gǎn mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ?

Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! You have become kings–and that without us! How I wish that you really had become kings so that we might be kings with you! ,"Mi ɖíe ko ɖó nǔ e ba wɛ mi ɖe lɛ́ɛ bǐ e. Mi ɖíe ko jɛ dɔkun e. Mi ko húzú axɔ́sú, có mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ka nyí axɔ́sú ǎ.

"For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession, like men condemned to die in the arena. We have been made a spectacle to the whole universe, to angels as well as to men. ","Đó mǐ mɛ mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, ɖo nukún ce mɛ ɔ́, é cí tɛn gǔdo tɔn ɔ́ mɛ wɛ Mawu sɔ́ mǐ ɖó ɖɔhun; mǐ cí mɛ e ɖó ná kú ɖo agbawungba ɔ́ ɖɔhun; mǐ húzú nǔkpínkpɔ́n nú gbɛ ɔ́ bǐ, bó húzú nǔkpínkpɔ́n nú wɛnsagun lɛ́ɛ kpó gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpó.

"We are fools for Christ, but you are so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, we are dishonored!

"We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it; ","Mǐ nɔ́ jɛ tagba bó nɔ́ wa azɔ̌, bó ná dó sixú nyí mi ɖésúnɔ; è ɖo mǐ zun wɛ ɔ́, mǐ nɔ́ ɖo fífá byɔ́ nú mɛ wɛ; è ɖo ya dó nú mǐ wɛ ɔ́, mǐ nɔ́ dɛ ɖ'é nu. "

"But I will come to you very soon, if the Lord is willing, and then I will find out not only how these arrogant people are talking, but what power they have.

"What do you prefer?

I have written you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people– ,Un byɔ́ mi ɖo wěma e un sɛ́ dó mi ɔ́ mɛ ɖɔ mi ní ma kpé nǔ ɖěbǔ xá agalɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ó. 
"not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world. ","Ényí agalɛtɔ́ nǔjlómɔnɔ, ajotɔ́ abǐ vodúnsɛntɔ́ gbɛ élɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpaa xó ɖɔ wɛ un ɖe ǎ. Ényí mi gbɛ́ ná hɔn nú mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɔ́, gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ jɛ́n mi ná tɔ́n sín. "
"But now I am writing you that you must not associate with anyone who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a slanderer, a drunkard or a swindler. With such a man do not even eat. ","Nǔ e ɖɔ nú mi wɛ un ɖe ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ mi ní ma kpé nǔ ɖěbǔ xá mɛ e ɖɔ émí nyí klísusɛntɔ́, bó ka nɔ ɖo aga lɛ wɛ, abǐ mɛ nú jló wɛ, abǐ vodún sɛn wɛ, abǐ nǔyá ɖɔ nú mɛ wɛ, ahan nu mú wɛ, abǐ ajo ja wɛ é ó.

"What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside?If any of you has a dispute with another, dare he take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the saints? ","Mɛ e ma nyí klísusɛntɔ́ ǎ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, nyɛ wɛ ná ɖɔ hwɛ xá yě ǎ; Mawu wɛ ná ɖɔ hwɛ xá yě. Lo ɔ́, mi ɖó ná ɖɔ hwɛ xá mɛ e nyí agunví mitɔn lɛ́ɛ é ǎ cé?

"Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases?

Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life! ,Mi tunwun ɖɔ mǐdɛɛ wɛ ná ɖɔ hwɛ xá wɛnsagun lɛ́ɛ ǎ cé? Ani ka lɛ́ nyí gbɛ élɔ́ mɛ sín nǔ lɛ́ɛ tɔn?

I say this to shame you. Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers? ,"Winnyá ní hu mi. Dandan mɛ ɔ́, gbɛtɔ́ nǔnywɛ́tɔ́ e ná sixú dó hwɛ gbɔ nú nɔví nɔví ɔ́ ɖokpó ná ɖo mi mɛ vɔ́vɔ́! "
"But instead, one brother goes to law against another–and this in front of unbelievers! ","Lo ɔ́, hwɛ jɛ́n nɔví ɖě ká ɖó ná ylɔ́ ɖě ɔ́ dandan a? Bɔ é ka ná lɛ́ nyí hwɛɖɔtɔ́ e ma nyí klísusɛntɔ́ ǎ lɛ́ɛ nukɔn a? "
The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated? ,"Nǔgbó ɔ́, hwɛgbe e nɔ ɖo tɛ́ntin mitɔn ɔ́ kɛ́ɖɛ́ ko ɖe xlɛ́ ɖɔ mi jɛ ayǐ bǐ gbídígbídí. Nɛ̌ ka gbɔn bɔ mi ma gbɔ bónú è wa nǔ agɔ dó mi ǎ?

"Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers. ","É nyɔ́ wa ɔ́, midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ nɔ ɖo nǔ agɔ wa wɛ, bó nɔ́ ɖo ajo ja wɛ, bɔ nɔví ɖo Klísu mɛ lɛ́ɛ wú wa nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ dó wɛ mi ka nɔ lɛ́ ɖe! "
Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders ,"Dandan mɛ ɔ́, mi tunwun ɖɔ mɛ e ɖo nǔ nyanya wa wɛ lɛ́ɛ kún ná mɔ tɛn ɖo axɔ́súɖuɖu Mawu tɔn mɛ ó; mi ma blɛ́ miɖée ó: agalɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, vodúnsɛntɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, mɛsibatɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, nyɔ̌nu e nɔ dó afɔ gbě lɛ́ɛ, súnnu e nɔ ɖó xó xá súnnu yětɔn ɖɔhun lɛ́ɛ, "

"And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.

“Everything is permissible for me”–but not everything is beneficial. “Everything is permissible for me”–but I will not be mastered by anything. ,"Mɛ ɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖo mi mɛ, bó nɔ ɖɔ: “Nǔ bǐ sín gbe wɛ è nǎ mì.” Nǔgbó wɛ!

"“Food for the stomach and the stomach for food”–but God will destroy them both. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. ","Mi nɔ lɛ́ ɖɔ: “Nǔɖuɖu nyí adɔgo tɔn, bɔ adɔgo nyí nǔɖuɖu tɔn.” Nǔgbó wɛ! É ka ɖo mɔ̌ có Mawu ná gblé gbɛ dó nú yě mɛ we lɛ́ɛ bǐ.

Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never! ,"Mi tunwun ɖɔ agbaza mitɔn lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, agbaza Klísu tɔn sín wǔjɔnú wɛ yě nyí ǎ cé? Hǔn un ná zé agbaza Klísu tɔn sín wǔjɔnú dó bló agbaza agalɛtɔ́ tɔn sín wǔjɔnú ná wɛ a? Gbeɖé kpɔ́n! "
"Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, “The two will become one flesh.” ","Abǐ mi tunwun ɖɔ súnnu e ɖó kɔnɖókpɔ́ xá nyɔ̌nu agalɛtɔ́ ɔ́, é kpó nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ kpó húzú ɖokpó ɔ́ ǎ cé?

But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with him in spirit. ,"Lo ɔ́, mɛ e ɖó kɔnɖókpɔ́ xá Aklúnɔ ɔ́, é kpó Aklúnɔ kpó húzú mɛ ɖokpó ɖo Yɛsinsɛn mɛ. "
"Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. ","Mi hɔn nú agalilɛ. Hwɛ ɖěvo ɖěbǔ e gbɛtɔ́ ná hu ɔ́, hwɛ énɛ́ ɔ́ ɖo zɔ nú agbaza tɔn; amɔ̌, mɛ e lɛ aga ɔ́ hu hwɛ dó agbaza é ɖésúnɔ tɔn. "
"Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; ","Mi tunwun ɖɔ agbaza mitɔn ɔ́, Yɛsinsɛn e Mawu ná mi, bɔ é ɖo mi mɛ ɔ́ sín sinsɛnxɔ wɛ é nyí ǎ cé? Mi nyí mi ɖésúnɔ tɔn ǎ: "
you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body.Now for the matters you wrote about: It is good for a man not to marry. ,"axivɛ́nu wɛ Mawu xɔ mi, lobo sú axɔ́.

"But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband. ","É ka ɖo mɔ̌ có, bónú è ma wá lɛ aga ó wútu ɔ́, nú súnnu ɖokpó ɖokpó ɖó asi é ɖésúnɔ tɔn, bónú nyɔ̌nu ɖokpó ɖokpó ɖó asú é ɖésúnɔ tɔn ɔ́, é nyɔ́ hú. "
"The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. ","Súnnu ɔ́ ɖó ná wa asúzɔ́ tɔn nú asi tɔn; mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ ɖó ná wa asizɔ́ tɔn nú asú tɔn. "
"The wife's body does not belong to her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not belong to him alone but also to his wife. ","Nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ ɖó acɛ dó agbaza é ɖésúnɔ tɔn jí ǎ; agbaza tɔn ɔ́, asú tɔn tɔn wɛ é nyí; mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, súnnu ɔ́ ɖó acɛ dó agbaza é ɖésúnɔ tɔn jí ǎ; agbaza tɔn ɔ́, asi tɔn tɔn wɛ é nyí. "
"Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. ","Mi ma gbɛ́ xɔ nú miɖée ó, afi nú mi ɖó gbe kpɔ́, bó ná nɔ mɔ̌ nú hwenu ɖé, bó ná sixú kpé nukún dó ɖɛxixo wú.

"I say this as a concession, not as a command. ","Nǔ énɛ́ e un ɖɔ nú mi ɔ́, sɛ́n wɛ é nyí bɔ un dó nú mi ǎ, amɔ̌ lě e é ɖe gbɔn nú nyɛ ɔ́ wɛ un ɖɔ nú mi. "
"I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, un jló ɖɔ mɛ bǐ ní nɔ nyɛ ɖɔhun; lo ɔ́, nǔníná mɛtɔn mɛtɔn wɛ Mawu ka ná mɛ; é ná ɖě mɛ ɖě, bó ná ɖěvo mɛ ɖě ɔ́. "
"Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am. ","Nǔ e ɖɔ nú mɛ e ma da asi ǎ lɛ́ɛ, abǐ mɛ e ma da asú ǎ lɛ́ɛ, kpódó asúkúsi lɛ́ɛ kpán wɛ un ɖe ɔ́ ɖíe: é nyɔ́ nú mi ní kpo ɖo mi ɖokpónɔ nɔ wɛ nyɛ ɖɔhun. "
"But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion. ","Amɔ̌, ényí mi ma sixú ɖu ɖo miɖée jí ǎ hǔn, mi da asi, abǐ mi da asú: ényí mi da asi abǐ mi da asú ɔ́, é nyɔ́ hú mi ní nɔ mɔ̌, bónú nyɔ̌nu biba abǐ súnnu biba sín jlǒ na ɖo jiji wɛ ɖo lan mitɔn mɛ myɔ ɖɔhun. "
"To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. ","Sɛ́n e dó nú asú kpó asi kpó lɛ́ɛ wɛ un ɖe ɔ́ ɖíe: nyɔ̌nu e da asú ɔ́ ɖó ná jó asú tɔn dó ǎ; súnnu ɖě ká ɖó ná nya asi tɔn ǎ (nyɛ ɖésúnɔ wɛ dó sɛ́n énɛ́ ɔ́ ǎ; lo ɔ́, Aklúnɔ ɖésú wɛ dó). Ényí nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ ka wá jó asú tɔn dó ɔ́, ní ma sɔ́ vɔ́ asú ɖěvo da ó, abǐ ní dó hwɛ gbɔ xá asú tɔn. "
"To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. ","Mɛɖě lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, nǔ e ɖɔ nú yě wɛ un ɖe ɔ́ ɖíe (nyɛ ɖésúnɔ wɛ ka ɖo ɖiɖɔ wɛ; é nyí Aklúnɔ wɛ ǎ).

"And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. ","Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, nú nyɔ̌nu e ɖi nǔ nú Klísu ɔ́ ɖě ɖó asú e ma ɖi nǔ nú Klísu ǎ é, bɔ súnnu ɔ́ ka yí gbe bó ná nɔ kpɔ́ xá ɛ ɔ́, nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ ɖó ná nya ɛ ǎ. "
"For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, súnnu e ma ɖi nǔ nú Klísu ǎ ɔ́ nyí mɛɖeɖóvo Mawu tɔn, ɖó bǔ e é kpó asi tɔn kpó ɖe ɔ́ wútu.

Ényí nǔ ma nyí mɔ̌ ǎ ɔ́, è nǎ nɔ́ mɔ vǐ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ dó mɔ mɛ blíblí, có mɛ mímɛ́ wɛ yě ká nyí. "
"But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so. A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. ","É ka ɖo mɔ̌ có, nú mɛ e ma ɖi nǔ nú Klísu ǎ ɔ́ jló ná klán xá asú tɔn abǐ asi tɔn e ɖi nǔ nú Klísu ɔ́ hǔn, é ní jó e dó ní yi; é nyí nǔ cí mɔ̌ ɔ́, hǔn asisúnɔ abǐ nyɔ̌nu ɖo asúxwé e ɖi nǔ nú Klísu ɔ́ jɛ éɖée sí; ɖó mǐ ná mɔ fífá wútu wɛ Mawu ylɔ́ mǐ. "
"How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? ","Hwi nyɔ̌nu e ɖi nǔ nú Klísu ɔ́, a tunwun nú a nǎ hwlɛ́n asú towe gán a? Abǐ hwi súnnu e ɖi nǔ nú Klísu ɔ́, a tunwun nú a nǎ hwlɛ́n asi towe gán a? "
"Nevertheless, each one should retain the place in life that the Lord assigned to him and to which God has called him. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches. ","Nǔ e wɛ kpowun ɔ́, mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó ɖó ná zán gbɛ tɔn, bɔ é ná sɔgbe xá nǔníná e Aklúnɔ ná ɛ é, bó ná sɔgbe xá lě e é ko ɖe gbɔn cóbɔ Mawu ylɔ́ ɛ é; sɛ́n e un ɖó ayǐ ɖo agun lɛ́ɛ bǐ mɛ ɔ́ nɛ́. "
Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be circumcised. ,"Ényí mɛɖé ko gbo ada cóbɔ Mawu ylɔ́ ɛ ɔ́, ní ma sɔ́ ba ná sɔ́ éɖée dó húzú mɛ e ma gbo ada ǎ é ó; ényí mɛɖé ma ka gbo ada cóbɔ Mawu ylɔ́ ɛ ǎ ɔ́, é ɖó ná yi gbo ada ǎ. "
Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God's commands is what counts. ,È gbo ada abǐ è ma gbo ada ǎ ɔ́ wɛ ɖo tají ǎ
Each one should remain in the situation which he was in when God called him. ,Mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó ɖó ná nɔ lě e é ɖe gbɔn hwenu e Mawu ylɔ́ ɛ é. 
"Were you a slave when you were called? Don't let it trouble you–although if you can gain your freedom, do so. ","Nú kannumɔ wɛ a nyǐ hwenu e Mawu ylɔ́ we ɔ́ hǔn, ado ma hu we ó; lo ɔ́, ényí ali ɖé wá hun nú we, bɔ a nǎ jɛ hwiɖée sí hǔn, hwlɛ̌ndó. "
"For he who was a slave when he was called by the Lord is the Lord's freedman; similarly, he who was a free man when he was called is Christ's slave. ","Đó mɛ e nyí kannumɔ bɔ Aklúnɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɔ́ nyí mɛ e jɛ éɖée sí, bó ɖo Aklúnɔ sín acɛ mɛ é; mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, mɛ e ɖo éɖée sí, bɔ Klísu ylɔ́ ɛ ɔ́ nyí Klísu sín kannumɔ. "

"Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy. ","Nǔ e kan mɛ e ma da asi ǎ abǐ asú ǎ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, Aklúnɔ ɖɔ xó ɖé nú mì d'é wú ǎ; lo ɔ́, nyɛ mɛ e Aklúnɔ bló bɔ un nyí mɛ e wú è hɛn ɔ́, è nǎ ɖeji dó gbɔn xomɛnyínyɔ́ tɔn gbla mɛ ɔ́, ma ɖɔ nǔ e un lin d'é wú ɔ́ nú mi.

"Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for you to remain as you are. ","Đó wǔvɛ́ mimɔ e ɖe din ɔ́ wútu ɔ́, nǔ e un lin d'é wú ɔ́ ɖíe: é nyɔ́ bónú gbɛtɔ́ ná nɔ lě e é ɖe gbɔn é. "
Are you married? Do not seek a divorce. Are you unmarried? Do not look for a wife. ,"Asi wɛ a ɖǒ hǔn, ma ba ná klán xá ɛ ó; a ma ɖó asi ǎ hǔn, ma ba ná da ó. "
"But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this. ","É ɖo mɔ̌ có, nú a da asi ɔ́, a hu hwɛ ǎ; nú ɖyɔ̌vǐ ɖé ka da asú ɔ́, é hu hwɛ ǎ.

"What I mean, brothers, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they had none; ","Nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ un ɖe, bó ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́ ɖíe: hwenu kpɛɖé wɛ kpo; bɛ́ sín din ɔ́, mɛ e da asi lɛ́ɛ ní zán gbɛ yě ma da asi ɖɔhun. "
"those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep; ",Mɛ e ɖo avǐ ya wɛ lɛ́ɛ ní cí yě ma ɖo avǐ ya wɛ ɖɔhun

I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs–how he can please the Lord. ,"É jló mì ɖɔ nǔlinlin ɖěbǔ ní ma nɔ ayixa mɛ nú mi ó. Mɛ e ma da asi ǎ ɔ́, Aklúnɔ sín nǔ lɛ́ɛ wú wɛ é nɔ kpé nukún dó; é nɔ ba ná nyɔ́ ɖo Aklúnɔ sí. "
But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world–how he can please his wife– ,"Lo ɔ́, mɛ e da asi ɔ́ nɔ kpé nukún dó gbɛmɛ fí sín nǔ lɛ́ɛ wú; é nɔ ba ná nyɔ́ ɖo asi tɔn sí. "
and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world–how she can please her husband. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, nǔ we wú kpé nukún dó wɛ é ɖe nɛ́.

They should get married. ","Un ná ɖɔ xó dó súnnu e ɖó asixɔ́ntɔn, abǐ nyɔ̌nu e ɖó asúxɔ́ntɔn ɔ́ wú.

"But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin–this man also does the right thing. ","Lo ɔ́, ényí dɔ̌nkpɛvú énɛ́ kpɔ́n ayi éɖée tɔn mɛ, bó ɖɔ émí kún ná da asi ó, bɔ é lí dǒ ɖo ayi tɔn mɛ, bɔ é ma ka nyí mɛɖé wɛ ɖɔ dandan mɔ̌ jɛ́n é ná bló ǎ, bɔ é mɔ ɖɔ émí hɛn ɔ́, émí ná ɖu ɖo jlǒ agbaza tɔn jí, bó kún ná ɖó alɔ asixɔ́ntɔn émítɔn wú ó ɔ́, nǔ ɖagbe wɛ é wa. "
"So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does even better. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, mɛ e da asixɔ́ntɔn tɔn ɔ́, nǔ ɖagbe wɛ é wa; mɛ e ma ka da ɛ ǎ ɔ́, é wa nǔ ɖagbe hú mɛ ɖě ɔ́. "
"A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord. ","Nyɔ̌nu e da asú ɔ́, ko ɖo bǔ xá asú tɔn káká yi jɛ hwenu e asú tɔn ɔ́ na nɔ gbɛ dó é.

"In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is–and I think that I too have the Spirit of God.Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that we all possess knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. ","É ɖo mɔ̌ có, nú é nɔ asú ma da ɔ́, é ná mɔ awǎjijɛ hú; lě e nyɛ mɔ gbɔn ɔ́ nɛ́; un ka tunwun ɖɔ nyi lɔ ɖó Yɛ Mawu tɔn.Din ɔ́, un ná ɖɔ xó dó nǔɖuɖu e è dǒ sá vɔ̌ nú vodún lɛ́ɛ wú.

The man who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know. ,"Mɛ e lin ɖɔ émí tunwun nǔɖé ɔ́, é ko tunwun nǔ ɔ́ lě e é ɖó ná tunwun gbɔn é ǎ. "
But the man who loves God is known by God. ,"Amɔ̌ mɛ e yí wǎn nú Mawu ɔ́, Mawu tunwun i. "
"So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world and that there is no God but one. ","Hǔn nǔ e kan nǔɖuɖu e è dǒ sá vɔ̌ nú vodún lɛ́ɛ ɖuɖu ɔ́, mǐ tunwun ganjí ɖɔ vodún ɖě kún ɖo gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ ó; mǐ tunwun ganjí ɖɔ Mawu ɖokpó géé wɛ tíin. "
"For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords”), ","Nú é tlɛ nyí ɖɔ nǔ gěgé tíin ɖo jǐnukúnsin kpódó ayǐkúngban jí kpán, bɔ mɛ lɛ́ɛ nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ mawu ɔ́, hǔn, “mawu” gěgé wɛ tíin, bɔ “aklúnɔ” gěgé tíin nɛ́. "
"yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live. ","Lo ɔ́, Mawu ɖokpó géé wɛ tíin nú mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ: é wɛ nyí Tɔ́ e ɖó nǔ bǐ é; é wɛ mǐ ɖo gbɛ ná; mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, Aklúnɔ ɖokpó géé wɛ tíin; é wɛ nyí Jezu Klísu e jí nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ tíin gbɔn é; é jí wɛ mǐ ɖo gbɛ gbɔn. "
"But not everyone knows this. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat such food they think of it as having been sacrificed to an idol, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled. ","Amɔ̌, mɛ bǐ mɔ nǔ jɛ nǔgbó énɛ́ wú ǎ. Mɛ ɖé lɛ́ɛ tíin, bɔ ée yě ko sɛn vodún ɖ'ayǐ káká bɔ é byɔ́ walɔ mɛ nú yě ɔ́, káká jɛ din ɔ́, yě lɛ́ kpo ɖo nǔɖuɖu énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖu wɛ, vodún tɔn wɛ nǔɖuɖu ɔ́ nyí ɖɔhun, bɔ ayixa yětɔn e má ɖó gǎn ǎ ɔ́ nɔ́ ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ yě blí. "
"But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do. ","Có é ma ka nyí nǔɖuɖu wɛ nɔ zɔ́n bɔ mǐ nɔ́ sɛkpɔ́ Mawu nɛ́; ényí mǐ ma ɖu ǎ ɔ́, nǔɖé gú mǐ ǎ; ényí mǐ ka ɖu ɔ́, le ɖé ɖ'é mɛ nú mǐ ǎ. "
"Be careful, however, that the exercise of your freedom does not become a stumbling block to the weak. ","É ɖo mɔ̌ có, mi cɔ́ miɖée, bónú miɖée sí e mi jɛ, bó dó ɖo nǔ wa ná wɛ ɔ́ ní ma dɔn mɛ e ma ɖó gǎn ɖo ayixa mɛ ǎ lɛ́ɛ dó hwɛ mɛ ó. "
"For if anyone with a weak conscience sees you who have this knowledge eating in an idol's temple, won't he be emboldened to eat what has been sacrificed to idols? ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, ényí mɛ e ma ɖó gǎn ɖo ayixa mɛ ǎ ɔ́ mɔ hwi mɛ e ɖɔ émí “tunwun nǔ” ɔ́ ɖo nǔ ɖu wɛ ɖo vodúnxɔ mɛ ɔ́, é ná ná ɛ akɔ́nkpinkpan, bɔ é ná ɖu nǔɖuɖu e è dǒ sá vɔ̌ ná nú vodún é ǎ cé? "
"So this weak brother, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge. ","É nyí mɔ̌ ɔ́, mɛ énɛ́ e ma ɖó gǎn ɖé ɖo ayixa mɛ ǎ ɔ́, nɔví ɖo Klísu mɛ énɛ́ e tamɛ Klísu kú dó ɔ́ ná dɔn, ɖó “nǔtunwuntunwun towe énɛ́” wútu! "
"When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. ","Ényí mi nɔ hu hwɛ dó nɔví mitɔn lɛ́ɛ gbɔn mɔ̌, bó nɔ dó akpa ayixa yětɔn e má ɖó gǎn lɛ́ɛ wú ɔ́, Klísu ɔ́ ɖésú wɛ mi hu hwɛ dó. "
"Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause him to fall.Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not the result of my work in the Lord? ","Énɛ́ wútu ɔ́, nú nǔɖuɖu wɛ ná zɔ́n bɔ nɔví ce ná jɛ hwɛ mɛ hǔn, un sɔ́ ná ɖu lan gbeɖé ǎ, bónú é ma sín nyɛ wútu nú nɔví ce jɛ hwɛ mɛ ó.Nyɛ ɖésúnɔ sí wɛ un ɖe ǎ cé? Mɛsɛ́dó wɛ un nyí ǎ cé?

"Even though I may not be an apostle to others, surely I am to you! For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord. ","Ényí ɖɔ mɛɖěvo tlɛ gbɛ́ ɖɔ un kún nyí mɛsɛ́dó ó ɔ́, midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mi ɖó ná tunwun dandan ɖɔ mɛsɛ́dó wɛ un nyí.

This is my defense to those who sit in judgment on me. ,"Mɛ e nɔ ɖo biba ná mɔ do nú mì wɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, xó e un nɔ dó hwlɛ́n nyɛɖée gán ɖo yě sí ɔ́ ɖíe: "
Don't we have the right to food and drink? ,"un ɖó acɛ bó ná yí nǔɖuɖu kpódó ahan kpó, ɖó azɔ̌ e wa wɛ un ɖe ɔ́ wú ǎ cé? "
"Don't we have the right to take a believing wife along with us, as do the other apostles and the Lord's brothers and Cephas ? ","Un ɖó acɛ bó ná da nɔví ɖo Klísu mɛ ɖokpó, bó ná kplá hɛn lě e Sefási kpó mɛsɛ́dó ɖě lɛ́ɛ kpó, kpódó Aklúnɔ sín nɔví lɛ́ɛ kpó bló gbɔn ɔ́ a cé? "
Or is it only I and Barnabas who must work for a living? ,"Abǐ nyɛ kpódó Baanabási kpó kɛ́ɖɛ́ jɛ́n ɖó ná wa azɔ̌, cóbó sixú mɔ nǔ e hu dó mǐ lɛ́ɛ a? "
Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its grapes? Who tends a flock and does not drink of the milk? ,Abǐ mi se kpɔ́n gbeɖé ɖɔ ahwan-yitɔ́ ɖé nɔ zé é ɖésúnɔ sín akwɛ́ dó wa ahwanzɔ́ ná wɛ a?

Do I say this merely from a human point of view? Doesn't the Law say the same thing? ,"Mi ma vɛdó ɖɔ gbɛtɔ́ sín linlin kpowun wɛ un dó ɖo xó ɖɔ ná wɛ sín ó, ɖó Mɔyízisɛ́n ɔ́ lɔmɔ̌ ɖɔ nǔ ɖokpó ɔ́. "
For it is written in the Law of Moses: “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” Is it about oxen that God is concerned? ,"Nǔgbó ɔ́, è wlán dó sɛ́n énɛ́ mɛ ɖɔ: “Mi ma dó aja nu nú nyibú e ɖo nǔkún só ɖó afɔ wú wɛ é ó.” Mawu nɔ jɛ tagba dó nyibú lɛ́ɛ tamɛ wɛ a? "
"Surely he says this for us, doesn't he? Yes, this was written for us, because when the plowman plows and the thresher threshes, they ought to do so in the hope of sharing in the harvest. ","Nú è nǎ ɖɔ nǔgbó ɔ́, mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ wú wɛ Mawu ɖɔ xó gbɔn mɔ̌ ǎ cé? Mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ wú wɛ è wlǎn xó énɛ́ dandan.

"If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you? ","Jinukún Yɛsinsɛn tɔn wɛ mǐ dó nyi ayi mitɔn mɛ: ényí jinukún ɔ́ ɖě wɛ mǐ ya ɖ'é mɛ ɖo dɔkun mitɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɔ́, nǔ wɛ mǐ wa zɛ jlɛ̌ wú a? "
"If others have this right of support from you, shouldn't we have it all the more? But we did not use this right. On the contrary, we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ. ","Ényí mɛɖěvo lɛ́ɛ ɖó acɛ énɛ́ ɖo mi jí ɔ́, mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖó acɛ énɛ́ ɖo mi jí hú yědɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ǎ cé?

"Don't you know that those who work in the temple get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar? ","Dandan mɛ ɔ́, mi tunwun ɖɔ mɛ e nɔ wa azɔ̌ ɖo sinsɛnxɔ mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, sinsɛnxɔ mɛ sín nǔɖuɖu wɛ yě nɔ́ ɖu; bɔ mɛ e nɔ xwlé vɔ̌sánú Mawu ɖo vɔ̌sákpe jí lɛ́ɛ nɔ mɔ yětɔn yí ɖo vɔ̌sánú énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ mɛ. "
"In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel. ","Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, Aklúnɔ ná gbe ɖɔ mɛ e ɖo Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ jlá wɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, azɔ̌ énɛ́ ní ná nǔɖuɖu yě. "
But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this in the hope that you will do such things for me. I would rather die than have anyone deprive me of this boast. ,"Lo ɔ́, un zé acɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó dó wa azɔ̌ ná ǎ; é ka nyí ɖɔ biba wɛ un ɖe wú wɛ un ɖo xó élɔ́ wlán wɛ ǎ. Ényí un kú ɔ́, é nyɔ́ nú mì hú è nǎ yí nǔ énɛ́ e zɔ́n bɔ un nɔ jlá ajɔ̌ nú nyɛɖée ɔ́ sín así ce. "
"Yet when I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, for I am compelled to preach. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! ","Un ná jlá ajɔ̌ nú nyɛɖée ɖó Wɛn Ɖagbe e jlá wɛ un ɖe ɔ́ wú ǎ; nǔgbó ɔ́, azɔ̌ ɖé wɛ é nyí bɔ è zɔ̌n mì ɖɔ ma wa dandan; ényí un ma jlá Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ ǎ hǔn, heelú mì. "
"If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; if not voluntarily, I am simply discharging the trust committed to me. ","Ényí nyɛ ɖésú wɛ zé azɔ̌ énɛ́ ɔ́, bó ɖo wiwa wɛ ɔ́, un sixú ɖó nukún ɖɔ un ná mɔ le tɔn. Lo ɔ́, ɖěe é nyí ɖɔ azɔ̌ wɛ é nyí, bɔ è ɖɔ un ɖó ná wa ɔ́, azɔ̌ e è zɔ́n mì ɔ́ wa wɛ un ɖe kpowun. "
"What then is my reward? Just this: that in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, and so not make use of my rights in preaching it. ","Le tɛ́ wɛ ka ɖ'é mɛ nú mì lo?

"Though I am free and belong to no man, I make myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible. ","Nyɛɖée sí wɛ un ɖe; un nyí mɛ ɖěbǔ sín kannumɔ ǎ; é ka ɖo mɔ̌ có, un sɔ́ nyɛɖée dó ɖó kannumɔ nú mɛ bǐ, bó ná dó dɔn mɛ gěgé wá Aklúnɔ li jí lě e un kpé wú gbɔn é. "

Therefore I do not run like a man running aimlessly,Fon
"No, I beat my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers, that our forefathers were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea.

They all ate the same spiritual food ,"Yě bǐ wɛ ɖu nǔɖuɖu Yɛsinsɛn tɔn ɖokpó ɔ́, "

"No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it. ","Mi mɔ tɛ́nkpɔ́n ɖěbǔ zɛ ée gbɛtɔ́ nɔ mɔ é wú ǎ.

I speak to sensible people,Fon
Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ? ,"Mi flín kɔ́fu e tamɛ mǐ nɔ́ dó kú nú Mawu dó ɖo Aklúnɔ sín nǔɖuɖu ɔ́ hwenu é: hwenu e mǐ ɖo ahan e ɖ'é mɛ ɔ́ nu wɛ ɔ́, é nɔ kɔn mǐ ɖó kpɔ́ xá Klísu sín hun ǎ cé?

You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too,Fon
Are we trying to arouse the Lord's jealousy? Are we stronger than he? ,Abǐ mǐ jlǒ ná bló bɔ Aklúnɔ ná jɛ wǔ hwan jí wɛ a? Mi vɛdó ɖɔ mǐ dó hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n hú i wɛ sín a? 
“Everything is permissible”–but not everything is beneficial. “Everything is permissible”–but not everything is constructive. ,"Mɛ ɖé lɛ́ɛ nɔ ɖɔ: “È nǎ nǔ bǐ sín gbe.” Nǔgbó wɛ! É ka ɖo mɔ̌ có, nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ ka nyɔ́ ǎ. “È nǎ nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ sín gbe”; é ɖo mɔ̌ có, nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ nɔ wa ɖagbe ǎ. "
"Nobody should seek his own good, but the good of others. ","Mɛɖěbǔ ní ma nɔ ba ɖagbe é ɖésúnɔ tɔn ó; lo ɔ́, ní nɔ ba ɖagbe mɛɖěvo lɛ́ɛ tɔn. "
"Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience, ","Mi hɛn ɔ́, mi ná ɖu nǔ e sa wɛ è ɖe ɖo axi mɛ é bǐ; ayixa mitɔn ma xo hun xá mi bónú mi kan nǔɖé byɔ́ ó. "
"for, “The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it.” ",Đó lě e Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ gbɔn ɔ́: “Aklúnɔ tɔn wɛ nyí ayǐkúngban kpódó nǔ e ɖ'é mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpó.” 
"If some unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience. ","Ényí mɛ e ma ɖi nǔ ǎ ɔ́ ɖě ylɔ́ mi dó nǔɖuɖu kɔn, bónú mi yí gbe bo yi hǔn, mi ɖu nǔ e é ná xwlé mi é bǐ; ayixa mitɔn ma xo hun xá mi bónú mi kan nǔɖé byɔ́ ó. "
"But if anyone says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat it, both for the sake of the man who told you and for conscience' sake – ","Amɔ̌ ényí mɛɖé ɖɔ nú mi ɖɔ: “Lan élɔ́ ɔ́, kanlin e è sɔ́ dó sá vɔ̌ ná nú vodún ɔ́ sín lan wɛ hǔn”, mi ma ɖu ó; ɖó mɛ e ɖɔ xó d'é wú nú mi ɔ́ wútu, nú ayixa ma xo hun xá mɛ ó. "
"the other man's conscience, I mean, not yours. For why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience? ","Ayixa midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ tɔn xó ɖɔ wɛ un ɖe ɖo fí ǎ; lo ɔ́, mɛ ɖě ɔ́ tɔn xó ɖɔ wɛ un ɖe.

"If I take part in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of something I thank God for? ","Nú un dó kú nú Mawu ɖó nǔ e ɖu wɛ un ɖe ɔ́ wú ɔ́, nɛ̌ ka gbɔn bɔ è nǎ ɖɔ xó dó wǔ ce, ɖó nǔɖuɖu énɛ́ e tamɛ un dó kú nú Mawu dó é?” "
"So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God. ","Nǔ ɖu wɛ mi ɖe oo, ahan nu wɛ mi ɖe oo, abǐ nǔ ɖěbǔ wa wɛ mi ɖe hǔn, mi bló bǐ, bó dó sɔ́ Mawu su. "
"Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God– ","Mi ma wa nǔ e ná nyí afɔklɛ́nnú nú Jwifu lɛ́ɛ, abǐ mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ, abǐ agun Mawu tɔn ɔ́ ɖěbǔ ó. "
"even as I try to please everybody in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved.Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ. ","Mi nɔ wa nǔ nyɛ ɖɔhun; un nɔ dó gǎn bó ná nyɔ́ ɖo mɛ bǐ sí, ɖo nǔ bǐ mɛ; un nɔ ba nyɛ ɖésúnɔ sín ɖagbe ǎ; lo ɔ́, ɖagbe mɛ bǐ tɔn wɛ un nɔ ba, bónú Mawu ná hwlɛ́n yě gán.Mi wa nǔ nyɛ ɖɔhun, lě e nyi lɔ nɔ wa nǔ Klísu ɖɔhun gbɔn é.

"I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the teachings, just as I passed them on to you. ","Un nɔ kpa mi, ɖó mi nɔ flín mì ɖo nǔ bǐ mɛ; mi nɔ xwedó nǔ e un kplɔ́n mi lɛ́ɛ. "
"Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. ","É ka ɖo mɔ̌ có, un jló ɖɔ mi ní mɔ nukúnnú jɛ nǔ élɔ́ wú: Klísu nyí gǎn nú súnnu bǐ; asisúnɔ nyí gǎn nú asi tɔn, bɔ Mawu ka nyí gǎn nú Klísu. "
Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. ,"Hǔn, ényí súnnu ɖé sɔ́ nǔɖé cyɔ́n ta hwenu e é ɖo ɖɛ xo wɛ, abǐ hwenu e Mawu sɔ́ xó ɖé dó nu n'i, bɔ é ɖo ɖiɖɔ wɛ ɔ́, Klísu ɖe kpo wɛ é ɖe. "
And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head–it is just as though her head were shaved. ,"Amɔ̌, ényí nyɔ̌nu ɖé ɖe nǔ e é cyɔ́n ta ɔ́ síin, hwenu e é ɖo ɖɛ xo wɛ, abǐ hwenu e Mawu sɔ́ xó ɖé dó nu n'i, bɔ é ɖo ɖiɖɔ wɛ ɔ́, asú tɔn ɖe kpo wɛ é ɖe; é cí nyɔ̌nu e xwlɛ́ ta ɔ́ ɖɔhun. "
"If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head. ","Nú nyɔ̌nu ɖé ma ka sɔ́ nǔɖé cyɔ́n ta ǎ ɔ́, é sixú kpa ɖa. Lo ɔ́, ɖěe é ka nyí ɖɔ ɖa kpikpa, abǐ ta xwlɛ́xwlɛ́ ɔ́, winnyánú wɛ é nyí nú nyɔ̌nu ɔ́, hǔn é ɖó ná sɔ́ nǔɖé cyɔ́n ta. "
"A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. ","É byɔ́ ɖɔ súnnu ní sɔ́ nǔɖé cyɔ́n ta ǎ; ɖó akpajlɛ́ Mawu tɔn kpó susu Mawu tɔn kpó wɛ é nyí; lo ɔ́, nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ susu súnnu tɔn wɛ é nyí. "
"For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, é nyí nyɔ̌nu wú wɛ Mawu ɖe súnnu sín ǎ; lo ɔ́, súnnu wú wɛ é ɖe nyɔ̌nu sín. "
"neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. ",Mawu bló súnnu nú nyɔ̌nu ǎ
"For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ nyɔ̌nu e ɖo asúxwé ɔ́, wuntun e ɖe xlɛ́ ɖɔ é ɖo asú tɔn sín acɛ mɛ ɔ́ ɖó ná ɖo ta tɔn ɖó wɛnsagun lɛ́ɛ wú. "
"In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. ","É ka ɖo mɔ̌ có, ɖo bǔ e mǐ ɖe xá Aklúnɔ ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, nyɔ̌nu sixú tíin súnnu mɛ vo ǎ; súnnu ka sixú tíin nyɔ̌nu mɛ vo ǎ. "
"For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God. ","Đó ée è ɖe nyɔ̌nu sín súnnu wú ɔ́, mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, nyɔ̌nu ji súnnu. Mawu wɛ ka bló nǔ bǐ. "
Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? ,"Mi ɖésúnɔ ɔ́, mi vɛ gbéjé kpɔ́n: é nyɔ́ bónú nyɔ̌nu ná nɔ ta vɔ́ hwenu e é ɖo xó ɖɔ xá Mawu wɛ ɔ́ a? "
"Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, ","Gbɛ ɔ́ ɖésú ko kplɔ́n mi ɖɔ nú ɖa e ɖo súnnu ta ɔ́ ɖi ga ɔ́, winnyánú wɛ é nyí n'i. "
"but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. ","Lo ɔ́, nú ɖa e ɖo ta nú nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ ka ɖi ga ɔ́, yɛ̌yinú wɛ é nyí n'i. Nǔgbó ɔ́, Mawu ná ɖa gaga nyɔ̌nu, bɔ ɖa ɔ́ ná cyɔ́n ta tɔn. "
"If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice–nor do the churches of God. ","Amɔ̌, nú mɛɖé ka jló ná lɛ́ dɔn nǔ dó xó énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, nǔ ɖokpó e é ná tunwun ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ: mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖó walɔ ɖěvo ǎ; agun Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ lɔ ka ɖó walɔ ɖěvo ǎ. "
"In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. ","Un sixú kpa mi ɖo xó e wú ná kɛ nu dó nú mi wɛ un ja din lɛ́ɛ mɛ ǎ, ɖó kplé e mi nɔ kplé lɛ́ɛ nɔ wa nyanya nú mi hú ɖagbe. "
"In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. ","Jɛ nukɔn ɔ́, un se ɖɔ, nú agun ɔ́ kplé ɔ́, gbɛ̌ta ɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖo mi mɛ, bɔ gbe yětɔn ɖo kpɔ́ ǎ. Un ka ɖi nǔ na kpɛɖé. "
No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval. ,"Kínklán ɖó ná nɔ tɛ́ntin mitɔn, bónú è nǎ dǒ tunwun mɛ e Mawu yí gbe nú nǔwiwa yětɔn lɛ́ɛ é. "
"When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat, ","Ényí mi kplé ɔ́, é nyí Aklúnɔ sín nǔɖuɖu ɔ́ wɛ mi nɔ ɖu ǎ. "
"for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, káká nú mi ná jɛ nǔɖuɖu kɔn lě ɔ́, mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó nɔ hwlɛ́ndó nǔɖuɖu é ɖésúnɔ tɔn, bó nɔ ɖu, bɔ hwenu e xovɛ́ ɖo mɛ ɖě sin wɛ ɔ́, mɛ ɖě nɔ ɖo ahan nu mú wɛ. "
Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not! ,"Étɛ́! Mi ɖó xwé, bó ná ɖu nǔ, bó ná nu ahan ɖ'é gbe ǎ cé? Abǐ mi gbɛ́ wǎn nú agun Mawu tɔn ɔ́ wɛ a? Mi jló ná dó winnyá mɛ e ma ɖó nǔɖé ǎ lɛ́ɛ wɛ a? Étɛ́ nɔ te kpɔ́n wɛ mi ɖe ɖɔ ma ɖɔ nú mi? Má kpa mi wɛ a? Éeǒ! Un sixú kpa mi nǔgbó ǎ! "
"For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, ","Đó nǔ e Aklúnɔ kplɔ́n mì bɔ un kplɔ́n mi ɔ́ ɖíe: Aklúnɔ Jezu ɔ́, zǎn e mɛ è sɔ́ ɛ jó ɔ́, é zé wɔ̌xúxú, "
"and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.” ","bó dó kú nú Mawu, bó kán, bó ɖɔ: “Élɔ́ ɔ́, agbaza ce e nyí mitɔn ɔ́ wɛ; mi ná nɔ bló gbɔn lě dó flín mì ná.” "
"In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.” ","Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, ée yě ɖu nǔ fó ɔ́, é zé kɔ́fu e mɛ vɛ̌ɛn ɖe ɔ́, bó ɖɔ: “Élɔ́ ɔ́, akɔjijɛ yɔ̌yɔ́ Mawu tɔn e sín afɔ hun ce sɔ́ ɖó te ɔ́ wɛ. Ényí mi ɖo nunu wɛ hweɖěbǔnu hǔn, mi nɔ nu dó flín mì ná.” "
"For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, káká jɛ hwenu e Aklúnɔ ná wá dó ɔ́, nú mi ɖo wɔ̌xúxú élɔ́ ɖu wɛ, bó ɖo nunu wɛ ɖo kɔ́fu élɔ́ mɛ hweɖěbǔnu ɔ́, kú e Aklúnɔ kú ɔ́ jlá wɛ mi ɖe. "
"Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. ","Énɛ́ wútu ɔ́, nú mɛɖé ɖu Aklúnɔ sín wɔ̌xúxú, abǐ é nu ɖo kɔ́fu tɔn mɛ dó acɛ jí ɔ́, nǔ wɛ é wa nyi do dó Aklúnɔ sín agbaza kpó hun tɔn kpó wú. "
A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. ,"Hǔn mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó ní bó kíjé éɖée mɛ kpɔ́n, cóbó ɖu wɔ̌xúxú élɔ́, abǐ cóbó nu ɖo kɔ́fu élɔ́ mɛ. "
For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself. ,"Đó, wɔ̌xúxú ɔ́ kpódó vɛ̌ɛn ɔ́ kpó ɔ́, nú mɛɖé ma tunwun nǔ e ɖo yě kpó agbaza Aklúnɔ tɔn kpó tɛ́ntin ɔ́ ǎ, bó ɖu wɔ̌xúxú ɔ́, lobo nu ɖo kɔ́fu ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, mɛ énɛ́ ɔ́ ɖo hwɛɖɔxámɛ Mawu tɔn dɔn dó éɖée jí wɛ, hwenu e é ɖo ɖuɖu wɛ, bó ɖo nunu wɛ é. "
"That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ mɛ gěgé ɖo mi mɛ, bó ɖo azɔn jɛ wɛ; mɛ gěgé gblé wɔ̌n; mɛ ɖě ká ko kú. "
"But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment. ","Ényí mǐ nɔ kíjé mǐ ɖésúnɔ sín ayixa mɛ kpɔ́n ɔ́, mǐ ná jɛ hwɛɖɔxámɛ Mawu tɔn mɛ ǎ. "
"When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world. ","Amɔ̌, ényí Aklúnɔ ɖo hwɛ ɖɔ xá mǐ wɛ ɔ́, tó dɔn nú mǐ wɛ é ɖe, bónú Mawu ma wá ɖó kúhwɛ nú mǐ kpódó yě mɛ e nyí gbɛ ɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó ó. "
"So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, nú mi kplé, bó ja nǔɖuɖu Aklúnɔ tɔn ɖu gbé hǔn, mi bo nɔ nɔ te kpɔ́n miɖée. "
"If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. And when I come I will give further directions.Now about spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant. ","Ényí xovɛ́ sin mɛɖé hǔn, ní nɔ ɖu nǔ ɖo xwé tɔn gbe, bó ma dɔn hwɛɖɔxámɛ Mawu tɔn dó mi jí ɖo kplé mitɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ ó.

"You know that when you were pagans, somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to mute idols. ","Mi tunwun ɖɔ hwenu e mi ma ko nyí klísusɛntɔ́ ǎ ɔ́, vodún e nyí nǔ bo ma sixú ɖɔ xó ǎ lɛ́ɛ kɔn wɛ nǔ ɔ́ nɔ dɔn mi yi, bɔ mi nɔ sixú gló ǎ. "
"Therefore I tell you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus be cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ un jló ɖɔ mi ní tunwun ganjí ɖɔ mɛ e Yɛsinsɛn sɔ́ xó dó ayi mɛ na bɔ é ɖo ɖiɖɔ wɛ ɔ́ sixú ɖɔ: “Jezu heelú we” ǎ; nú Yɛsinsɛn ma ka sɔ́ xó dó ayi mɛ nú mɛɖé ǎ ɔ́, mɛ ɔ́ sixú ɖɔ: “Jezu wɛ nyí Aklúnɔ” ǎ. "
"There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. ","Nǔníná Yɛsinsɛn tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, alɔkpa alɔkpa wɛ tíin; lo ɔ́, Yɛsinsɛn ɖokpó ɔ́ jɛ́n nɔ na mɛ. "
"There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. ","Mawuzɔ̌ wiwa tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ wɛ tíin; lo ɔ́, Aklúnɔ ɖokpó ɔ́ wa ná wɛ è ka ɖe. "
"There are different kinds of working, but the same God works all of them in all men. ","Nǔwiwa Mawu tɔn tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ wɛ tíin, lo ɔ́, Mawu ɖokpó ɔ́ jɛ́n ɖo nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ wa wɛ gbɔn mɛ bǐ mɛ. "
Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. ,"Yɛsinsɛn nɔ zé nǔníná ɖé dó ɖe éɖée xlɛ́ ɖo mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó sín gbɛzán mɛ, nú ɖagbe mɛ bǐ tɔn. "
"To one there is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, to another the message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, ","Yɛsinsɛn nɔ ná mɛ ɖě, bɔ é nɔ ɖɔ xó kpó nǔnywɛ́ kpó; é ɖokpó ɔ́ nɔ lɛ́ ná mɛ ɖě, bɔ é nɔ ɖɔ mɛ e tunwun nǔ ɔ́ sín xó. "
"to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, ","Yɛsinsɛn ɖokpó géé énɛ́ nɔ ná nǔɖiɖi mɛ ɖě, bó nɔ ná acɛ e nɔ gbɔ azɔn nú mɛ ɔ́ mɛ ɖě. "
"to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues. ","Yɛsinsɛn nɔ ná acɛ mɛ ɖě, bɔ é ná sixú jlɛ́ nǔ; é nɔ ná mɛ ɖě, bɔ é nɔ ɖɔ xó e Mawu sɔ́ dó nu n'i ɖɔ é ní ɖɔ lɛ́ɛ; é nɔ lɛ́ ná mɛɖěvo, bɔ é nɔ sixú tunwun yɛ nǔgbó ɔ́ ɖo yɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ mɛ.

"All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he gives them to each one, just as he determines. ",Yɛsinsɛn ɖokpó géé ɔ́ jɛ́n nɔ bló nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ
"The body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts; and though all its parts are many, they form one body. So it is with Christ. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, Klísu cí agbaza ɖokpó géé ɖɔhun, bɔ wǔjɔnú gěgé ɖo wǔ tɔn; wǔjɔnú gěgé wɛ ɖo agbaza énɛ́ wú, có agbaza ɖokpó wɛ é nyí, "
"For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body–whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free–and we were all given the one Spirit to drink. ","bɔ mǐ bǐ ɔ́, Jwifu kpó mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ kpó, kannumɔ kpó mɛ e ɖo é ɖésúnɔ sí ɔ́ kpó ɔ́, mǐ bǐ wɛ è zě Yɛsinsɛn ɖokpó ɔ́ dó lɛ yɛhwesin ná, bónú mǐ ná nyí agbaza ɖokpó; Yɛsinsɛn ɖokpó énɛ́ wɛ mǐ bǐ nu. "
Now the body is not made up of one part but of many. ,"Wǔjɔnú ɖokpó géé wɛ bló agbaza ǎ; lo ɔ́, wǔjɔnú gěgé wɛ. "
"If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body. ","Ényí afɔ ɖɔ: “Ée un ma nyí alɔ ǎ wútu ɔ́, un nyí agbaza tɔn ǎ”; énɛ́ ɔ́ wɛ ná zɔ́n bɔ é ná gɔn wǔjɔnú agbaza tɔn nyí a? "
"And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body. ","Ényí tó ka ɖɔ: “Ée un ma nyí nukún ǎ wútu ɔ́, un nyí agbaza tɔn ǎ”; énɛ́ ɔ́ wɛ na zɔ́n bɔ é ná gɔn wǔjɔnú agbaza tɔn nyí a? "
"If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? ","Nú agbaza ɔ́ bǐ ɔ́ nukún wɛ é nyí ɔ́, nɛ̌ é ka na se nǔ gbɔn? É ka nyí tó wɛ é nyí ɔ́, nɛ̌ é ná se nǔ wǎn gbɔn? "
"But in fact God has arranged the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, Mawu sɔ́ wǔjɔnú lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó ɖó agbaza wú, lě e é jló e gbɔn é. "
"If they were all one part, where would the body be? ","Ényí wǔjɔnú lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɔ́, nǔ ɖokpó géé wɛ yě nyí ɔ́, hǔn agbaza na tíin ǎ! "
"As it is, there are many parts, but one body. ","Hǔn wǔjɔnú gěgé wɛ tíin, bɔ agbaza ɖokpó géé tíin. "
"The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don't need you!” And the head cannot say to the feet, “I don't need you!” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, nukún sixú ɖɔ nú alɔ ɖɔ nǔ tɔn kún hu dó émí ó ǎ. Ta lɔ ka sixú ɖɔ nú afɔ ɖɔ nǔ tɔn kún hu dó émí ó ǎ. "
"On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, ","É nyɔ́ wa ɔ́, wǔjɔnú agbaza tɔn e è nɔ mɔ ɖɔ yě kún ɖó gǎn ɖěbǔ ó lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, è sixú ɖe yě kpo ǎ. "
"and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, ","Ée mǐ ma nɔ́ ké ya ɖé ná ǎ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mǐ nɔ́ kpé nukún dó yě wú hú ɖě lɛ́ɛ.

"while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it, ","Ée ka nyɔ́ kpɔ́n tawun ɖo agbaza mǐtɔn wú lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mǐ nɔ wlí yɛ̌yi nú yě sɔ mɔ̌ ǎ.

"so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. ","bónú kínklán ní ma ɖo agbaza ɔ́ mɛ ó; lo ɔ́, nú wǔjɔnú tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ na kpé nukún dó yěɖée wú, gbɔn agbaza ɖokpó ɔ́ mɛ. "
"If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it. ","Nú agbaza ɔ́ sín wǔjɔnú ɖé ɖo wǔvɛ́ mɔ wɛ ɔ́, wǔjɔnú ɖě lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ nɔ mɔ wǔvɛ́ xá ɛ; ényí è ka wlí yɛ̌yi nú ɖokpó ɔ́, ɖě lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ nɔ j'awǎ xá ɛ. "
"Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it. ","Agbaza Klísu tɔn wɛ mi bǐ nyí, bɔ mi mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó nyí wǔjɔnú ɖo agbaza énɛ́ ɔ́ wú. "
"And in the church God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, also those having gifts of healing, those able to help others, those with gifts of administration, and those speaking in different kinds of tongues. ","Đo agun ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, Mawu to mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ jɛ nukɔn; gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ bɔ d'é wú, bɔ nǔkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ nyí atɔngɔ́ ɔ́; énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, yě mɛ e nɔ jlɛ́ nǔ lɛ́ɛ jɛ fínɛ́, bɔ yě mɛ e ɖó acɛ e nɔ gbɔ azɔn nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ jɛ yě gúdo; mɛ e nɔ gɔ́ alɔ nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ kpó agunvíjíkpɔ́ntɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpó, kpó yě mɛ e è nǎ bɔ yě nɔ ɖɔ xó dó gbe tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ mɛ lɛ́ɛ kpó jɛ gǔdo yětɔn.

"But eagerly desire the greater gifts. And now I will show you the most excellent way.If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. ","Ényí mɔ̌ hǔn, nǔníná e ɖo tají hú ɖě lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɔ́ ní bó myá nukún nú mi.

"If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.

"If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing. ","Nú un ná bó má dɔkun ce lɛ́ɛ bǐ nú mɛ, un na bo sɔ́ agbaza ce dó sá vɔ̌, bɔ è dǒ zo, bɔ un ma ka ɖó wǎn yíyí ǎ ɔ́, nǔɖé ɖ'é mɛ nú mì ǎ. "
"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. ",Wǎn yíyí nɔ kú hǔn
"It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. ",Wǎn yíyí nɔ́ wa winnyánú ɖěbǔ ǎ
Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. ,"Nǔ agɔ wiwa wɛ nɔ hun xomɛ nú mɛ e ɖó wǎn yíyí é ǎ; lo ɔ́, nǔgbó wɛ nɔ hun xomɛ n'i. "
"It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. ","Wǎn yíyí nɔ́ zɔ́n bɔ è nɔ dɛ ɖo nǔ bǐ nu; ényí mǐ ná bó ɖo ninɔmɛ ɖěbǔ mɛ ɔ́, wǎn yíyí ɔ́ nɔ hɛn nǔɖiɖi mǐtɔn, kpó nukúnɖíɖó mǐtɔn kpó, kpódó hǔnkúkú mǐtɔn kpán ɖó te. "
"Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. ",Wǎn yíyí ná vɔ gbeɖé ǎ
"For we know in part and we prophesy in part, ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, mǐ tunwun nǔ yi kpé ǎ; mǐ ka ɖɔ Mawuxó ɔ́ yi kpé ǎ. "
"but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. ","Amɔ̌, hwenu e nǔ e sɔgbe é ná wá ɔ́, nǔ e ma sɔgbe ǎ ɔ́ ná bú. "
"When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. ","Hwenu e un ɖo yɔkpɔ́vú ɔ́, un nɔ ɖɔ xó yɔkpɔ́vú ɖɔhun, bó nɔ lin nǔ yɔkpɔ́vú ɖɔhun, lobɔ ayixa ce nɔ mɔ nǔ yɔkpɔ́vú ɖɔhun; lo ɔ́, ée un wá húzú mɛxó ɔ́, nǔ e nyí yɔkpɔ́vú tɔn lɛ́ɛ bú. "
"Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. ","Din ɔ́, nǔ e mɔ wɛ mǐ ɖe ɔ́ cí è ɖo nǔ mɔ wɛ vlivli ɖo nǔkpɛ́n e kú ɔ́ mɛ ɖɔhun.

"And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy. ","Nǔ atɔn e ná nɔ ayǐ sɔ́yi lɛ́ɛ ɖíe: nǔɖiɖi, nukúnɖíɖó kpó wǎn yíyí kpó; wǎn yíyí wɛ ka hú gǎn yě bǐ.Hǔn wǎn yíyí wɛ mi ná nɔ ba jɛ nukɔn nú nǔ bǐ; mi nɔ ba nǔníná Yɛsinsɛn tɔn lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌; ɖo tají ɔ́, mi nɔ ba ná yí wɛn ɖo Mawu sí bó dó. "
"For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God. Indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries with his spirit. ","Mɛ e ɖo xó ɖɔ dó gbe tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ mɛ wɛ ɔ́, gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ xó ná wɛ é ɖe ǎ; lo ɔ́, Mawu ɖɔ xó ná wɛ é ɖe; ɖó mɛɖé mɔ nukúnnú jɛ nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ é ɖe ɔ́ mɛ ǎ. Nǔbúdo ɖɔ wɛ é ɖe gbɔn Yɛsinsɛn sín hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n jí. "
"But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their strengthening, encouragement and comfort. ","Amɔ̌, mɛ e yí wɛn ɖo Mawu sí bó ɖo dǐdó wɛ ɔ́, gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ xó ná wɛ é ɖe, bónú yě ná dó yi nukɔn ɖo nǔɖiɖi mɛ, bó ná dó ná akɔ́nkpinkpan yě, bó ná dó dó gbɔ nú yě. "
"He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church. ","Mɛ e ɖo xó ɖɔ dó gbe tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ mɛ wɛ ɔ́, é ɖésúnɔ ná hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n wɛ é ɖe; lo ɔ́, mɛ e yí wɛn ɖo Mawu sí bó ɖo dǐdó wɛ ɔ́, agun ɔ́ bǐ dɔn yi nukɔn wɛ é ɖe ɖo nǔɖiɖi mɛ. "
"I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified. ","Un jló ganjí ɖɔ mi bǐ ní ɖɔ xó dó gbe tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ mɛ; lo ɔ́, mi ní yí wɛn ɖo Mawu sí bó dó ɔ́ ka jló mì hú.

"Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction? ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, un ná kan nǔ élɔ́ byɔ́ mi: ényí un wá mi gɔ́n, bó ɖɔ xó nú mi dó gbe tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ mɛ ɔ́, nǔ ɖagbe tɛ́ un ka wa nú mi? Un ná nyí nǔɖéwanú nú mi ɖo nǔ ɖěbǔ mɛ ǎ; afi nú é nyí ɖɔ nǔɖé wɛ Mawu ɖe xlɛ́ mì bɔ un ɖɔ nú mi; abǐ nǔɖé wɛ un tunwun bo ɖɔ nú mi, abǐ wɛn ɖé wɛ un yí ɖo Mawu sí bó dó mi; abǐ nǔɖé wɛ un kplɔ́n mi. "
"Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the flute or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes? ","Mi nú mǐ ná kpɔ́n nǔ dó nǔxonú lɛ́ɛ wú; mǐ ní sɔ́ kpete, abǐ agǐdigbo: nú gbe e dó wɛ é ɖe lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, ɖě ma gbɔn vo nú ɖě ǎ ɔ́, nɛ̌ wɛ è nǎ sixú tunwun nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ kpete ɔ́ ɖe ɔ́, abǐ nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ agǐdigbo ɔ́ ɖe ɔ́ gbɔn? "
"Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle? ","Ényí mɛ e ɖo ahwankpɛn kún wɛ ɔ́, ma kún céɖécéɖé tɔn ǎ ɔ́, mɛ̌ ka ná sɔ́ ahwan nú? "
"So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air. ","Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, ényí mi ma ɖɔ xó dó gbe e è se ɔ́ mɛ ǎ ɔ́, nɛ̌ wɛ è nǎ sixú mɔ nukúnnú jɛ nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ mi ɖe ɔ́ wú gbɔn? Xó ɖɔ dó jɔhɔn mɛ wɛ é ná nyí. "
"Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning. ",Gbe e ɖo gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ sukpɔ́
"If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and he is a foreigner to me. ","É ka ɖo mɔ̌ có, nú un ma se gbe e mɛ ɖɔ xó nú mì dó wɛ è ɖe ɔ́ ǎ ɔ́, mɛ e ɖo xó ɖɔ nú mì dó gbe énɛ́ mɛ wɛ ɔ́, un ná nyí akɔmasegbe n'i; éyɛ́ lɔ ná nyí akɔmasegbe nú mì. "
"So it is with you. Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts that build up the church. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, ɖěe é nyí ɖɔ nǔníná Yɛsinsɛn tɔn lɛ́ɛ ba wɛ mi ɖe vɛ́návɛ́ná ɔ́, mi ní ba ée ná zɔ́n bɔ agun ɔ́ ná yi nukɔn tawun lɛ́ɛ é, bónú yě ní sukpɔ́ ɖo mi sí. "
For this reason anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret what he says. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, mɛ e ɖo xó ɖɔ dó gbe tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ mɛ wɛ ɔ́ ɖó ná byɔ́ Mawu ɖɔ ní ná émí, bónú émí ná nɔ sixú tín gbe énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ mɛ. "
"For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. ","Đó nú un ɖo ɖɛ xo dó gbe mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ wɛ ɔ́, ayi ce ɖo ɖɛ mɛ nǔgbó; lo ɔ́, nǔnywɛ́ ce ka ɖo azɔ̌ wa wɛ ǎ. "
"So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind. ","Hǔn nɛ̌ wɛ un ka ná wa gbɔn? Un ná xo ɖɛ kpó ayi ce kpó, bó ka ná xo ɖɛ kpó nǔnywɛ́ ce lɔmɔ̌ kpó, bó ka ná ji han kpó ayi ce kpó, bó ka ná ji kpó nǔnywɛ́ ce lɔmɔ̌ kpó. "
"If you are praising God with your spirit, how can one who finds himself among those who do not understand say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying? ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, ényí a ɖo kú dó nú Mawu wɛ ɖo ayi mɛ kɛ́ɖɛ́ ɔ́, nɛ̌ wɛ mɛ e ɖo fínɛ́, bó ma mɔ nǔ jɛ mɛ ǎ ɔ́ ná sixú yí gbe ɖɔ “Amǐ” nú kú dó nú Mawu sín ɖɛ e xo wɛ a ɖe ɔ́ gbɔn? É sixú tunwun nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ a ɖe ɔ́ ǎ. "
"You may be giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified. ","Nú kú dó nú Mawu sín ɖɛ e xo wɛ a ɖe ɔ́ tlɛ nyɔ́ káká ɔ́, é d'alɔ mɛ ɖě ɔ́ bɔ é yi nukɔn ǎ. "
I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. ,"Un dó kú nú Mawu, ɖó é bló bɔ un nɔ ɖɔ xó dó gbe tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ mɛ hú mi bǐ. "
But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue. ,"Lo ɔ́, nú un ka ɖo agun mɛ ɔ́, un nɔ ba ná ɖɔ xógbe e è nǎ mɔ nukúnnú jɛ mɛ ɔ́ atɔ́ɔ́n, bó ná dó kplɔ́n nǔ mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ hú má ɖɔ xógbe děgba we afɔwó (10.000) dó gbe tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ mɛ. "
"Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults. ","Nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, mi ma nyí yɔkpɔ́vú ɖo linlin mitɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ ó; mi ní nyí yɔkpɔ́vú ɖo nǔ e kunkplá nǔ nyanya é mɛ; amɔ̌, mi ní nyí mɛxó ɖo linlin mitɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ. "
"In the Law it is written: “Through men of strange tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me,” says the Lord. ","Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Mɛ e nɔ dó gbe ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ jí wɛ un ná ɖɔ xó nú togun élɔ́ gbɔn; akɔmasegbe lɛ́ɛ sín nu mɛ wɛ un ná ɖɔ xó nú yě gbɔn; nú un na bo bló gbɔn mɔ̌ ɔ́, yě ná ba ná se xó ce ǎ.” Xó e Aklúnɔ ɖɔ ɔ́ nɛ́. "
"Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, wuntun ɖé wɛ xó ɖɔ dó gbe tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ mɛ nyí nú mɛ e ma ɖi nǔ ǎ lɛ́ɛ; é ka nyí mɔ̌ nú mɛ e ɖi nǔ lɛ́ɛ ǎ; é nyɔ́ wa ɔ́, wɛn yí ɖo Mawu sí bó dó ɔ́, wuntun ɖé wɛ é nyí nú mɛ e ɖi nǔ lɛ́ɛ, é ka nyí mɔ̌ nú mɛ e ma ɖi nǔ lɛ́ɛ ǎ. "
"So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who do not understand or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind? ","Hǔn, mǐ ní ɖɔ agun ɔ́ bǐ kplé bɔ mɛ bǐ jɛ xó ɖɔ dó gbe tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ mɛ jí: nú gbɛtɔ́ kpaa lɛ́ɛ abǐ mɛ e ma ɖi nǔ ǎ lɛ́ɛ byɔ́ fí e mi ɖe ɔ́, yě ná ɖɔ taɖu wɛ mi hun ǎ cé? "
"But if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand comes in while everybody is prophesying, he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and will be judged by all, ","Lo ɔ́, nú mɛ bǐ ka yí wɛn ɖo Mawu sí bó ɖo dǐdó wɛ, bɔ mɛ e ma ɖi nǔ ǎ, abǐ gbɛtɔ́ kpaa ɖé byɔ́ fínɛ́ ɔ́, xó e se wɛ é ɖe ɔ́ ná zɔ́n, bɔ ayi tɔn ná mɔ hwɛ e é hu ɔ́; nǔ e se wɛ é ɖe ɔ́ bǐ ná nɔ ɖɔ hwɛ dó e. "
"and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare. So he will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, “God is really among you!” ","Bɔ nǔ e ɖo hwlǎhwlá ɖo ayi tɔn mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ sésé ná jɛ wě jí. Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, é ná cyɔ́n nukún mɛ ayǐ, bó ná sɛn Mawu, bó ná ɖɔ: “Mawu ɖo tɛ́ntin mitɔn nǔgbó.” "
"What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church. ","Nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, étɛ́ wɛ mǐ ná ɖɔ dó sú ta ná? Ényí mi kplé, bónú mɛɖé ɖó han ɖé bó ná ji hǔn, ní ji; mɛɖé ɖó nǔkplɔ́nmɛ ɖé bó ná kplɔ́n mɛ hǔn, ní kplɔ́n mɛ; mɛɖé ɖó nǔɖexlɛ́mɛ ɖé bó ná ɖe xlɛ́ mɛ hǔn, ní ɖe xlɛ́; mɛɖé ɖó xó ɖé bó ná ɖɔ dó gbe tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ mɛ hǔn, ní ɖɔ; mɛɖé ɖo gbe e dó wɛ mɛ ɖě ɔ́ ɖe ɔ́ ná tínmɛ wɛ hǔn, ní tínmɛ; è ɖǒ ná bló nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ, dó dó alɔ agun ɔ́, bɔ é ná yi nukɔn. "
"If anyone speaks in a tongue, two–or at the most three–should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret. ","Ényí è jɛ xó ɖɔ dó gbe tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ mɛ jí ɔ́, mɛ e ná ɖɔ lɛ́ɛ ní ma sɔ́ hú mɛ we, abǐ mɛ atɔn ó; mɛ ɖě ɔ́ ka ɖó ná ɖɔ étɔn fó hwɛ̌, cóbɔ mɛɖěvo ná yí; mɛɖé ní ka tín nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ yě ɖe ɔ́ mɛ. "
"If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and God. ","Nú mɛɖé ma ɖo fínɛ́ bó ná tín nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ è ɖe ɔ́ mɛ ǎ hǔn, yě ní nɔ abwɛ̌ ɖo agun ɔ́ mɛ; è nǐ ɖɔ xó nú mɛɖée, bó ɖɔ xó nú Mawu. "
"Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said. ","Ényí mɛ e Mawu nɔ dó wɛn lɛ́ɛ ɖě ja xó ɖɔ gbé hǔn, yě mɛ we, abǐ yě mɛ atɔn ní yí xó, bónú mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ ní gbéjé nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ yě ɖe lɛ́ɛ kpɔ́n. "
"And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. ","Amɔ̌, nú mɛɖé ɖo fínɛ́ bɔ Mawu ɖe nǔɖé xlɛ́ ɛ ɔ́, mɛ e ɖo xó ɖɔ wɛ ɔ́ ɖó ná nɔ abwɛ̌. "
For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged. ,"Mi bǐ sixú dó wɛn Mawu tɔn ɔ́, mɛ ɖě jɛ mɛ ɖě gúdo, bó ná dó ná kplɔ́n kpódó akɔ́nkpinkpan kpó mɛ bǐ. "
The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets. ,"Yě mɛ e ɖo wɛn mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn dó wɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖó ná ɖu ɖo yěɖée jí, ɖo nǔníná e Mawu ná yě ɔ́ nukɔn. "
"For God is not a God of disorder but of peace. As in all the congregations of the saints, ","Đó Mawu ylɔ́ mǐ, bónú mǐ ná zán gbɛ hannyahannya ǎ, lo ɔ́, mǐ ná mɔ fífá wútu wɛ é ylɔ́ mǐ. Lě e é kó nɔ nyí gbɔn ɖo mɛɖeɖóvo Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ sín agun lɛ́ɛ bǐ mɛ ɔ́, "
"women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. ","nyɔ̌nu lɛ́ɛ ɖó ná nɔ abwɛ̌ hwenu e agun ɔ́ kplé é: è nǎ gbe yě ɖɔ yě ní ɖɔ xó ǎ; lě e sɛ́n ɔ́ lɔmɔ̌ ɖɔ gbɔn ɔ́, yě ɖó ná hwíhwɛ́ yěɖée. "
"If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. ","Ényí yě ɖo nǔɖé sín do ba wɛ hǔn, yě ní kan xó byɔ́ asú yětɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖo xwé gbe. É nyɔ́ bónú yě ná ɖɔ xó ɖo agun ɔ́ mɛ ǎ. "
Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached? ,Abǐ mi gɔ́n wɛ Mawuxó ɔ́ gosín a? Abǐ midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ kɛ́ɖɛ́ gɔ́n wɛ é wá a? 
"If anybody thinks he is a prophet or spiritually gifted, let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command. ","Ényí mɛɖé lin ɖɔ émí nyí gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn, abǐ é lin ɖɔ émí ɖó nǔníná Yɛsinsɛn tɔn ɖé ɔ́, mɛ ɔ́ ɖó ná tunwun ɖɔ nǔ e Aklúnɔ zɔ́n ɔ́ wɛ nyí nǔ e wlán sɛ́ dó mi wɛ un ɖe é. "
"If he ignores this, he himself will be ignored. ","Amɔ̌, nú mɛɖé má ké ya nú nǔkplɔ́nmɛ élɔ́ ǎ hǔn, mɛɖé má ké ya nú é lɔmɔ̌ ó. "
"Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, nǔ e mi ɖó ná nɔ ba ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ mi ná nɔ dó wɛn e Mawu dó mi é; amɔ̌, mi ma gbɛ́ xó ɖɔ dó gbe tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ mɛ ó. "
"But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.Now, brothers, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. ","È nǐ bló nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ lě e é jɛ xá gbɔn é; è nǐ bló kpó tito kpó.Nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, din ɔ́, un jló ná flín Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ mi; Wɛn Ɖagbe e un jlá mi, bɔ mi yí, lobɔ nǔɖiɖi mitɔn tɛ́ d'é wú syɛ́nsyɛ́n é. "
"By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. ","É jí wɛ Mawu hwlɛ́n mi gán gbɔn; ényí mi hɛn dó ayi mɛ lě e un kplɔ́n mi gbɔn ɔ́ nɛ́; é ma nyí mɔ̌ ǎ ɔ́, nǔ e mi ɖi ɔ́ ná nyí nǔ yǎyá. "
"For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance : that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, ","Nǔ e è kplɔ́n mì ɔ́ wɛ un kplɔ́n mi, nǔkplɔ́nmɛ e ɖo tají hú ɖě lɛ́ɛ é; é wɛ nyí ɖɔ: Klísu kú ɖó hwɛ mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ tamɛ lě e Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ko ɖɔ gbɔn é. "
"that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, ","È ɖi i, bɔ azǎn tɔn atɔngɔ́ ɔ́ gbe ɔ́, è fɔ́n ɛ sín kú lě e Mawuxówéma ɔ́ kó ɖɔ gbɔn é. "
"and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve. ","Ée é fɔ́n ɔ́, é sɔ́ éɖée xlɛ́ Sefási, bó wá sɔ́ éɖée xlɛ́ mɛsɛ́dó wěwe lɛ́ɛ. "
"After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, é sɔ́ éɖée xlɛ́ nɔví ɖo Klísu mɛ afɔwe kanwe ko (500) jɛjí zɛ̌ɛ́n. Yě mɛ gěgé lɛ́ kpo ɖo gbɛ, mɛ ɖě ká kó kú. "
"Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, é sɔ́ éɖée xlɛ́ Jaki, bó wá sɔ́ éɖée xlɛ́ mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ bǐ. "
"and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born. ","Ée é sɔ́ éɖée xlɛ́ yě bǐ ɔ́, é wá sɔ́ éɖée xlɛ́ nyɛ lɔmɔ̌ gbɔn gǔdo; có mɛ e azǎn ma sɔgbe bɔ è ji ɖɔhun wɛ un cí. "
"For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, nyɛ wɛ nyí mɛ e gbɔn gǔdo bǐ ɖo mɛsɛ́dó lɛ́ɛ mɛ é. Ényí è nǎ ɖɔ nǔgbó ɔ́, é jɛ xá ɖɔ è nǐ ylɔ́ mì ɖɔ mɛsɛ́dó ǎ, ɖó un dó ya nú agun Mawu tɔn. "
"But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them–yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. ","Amɔ̌, gbɔn nyɔ̌ná Mawu tɔn gbla mɛ ɔ́, un húzú mɛ e un nyí din é, bɔ nyɔ̌ná e è kɔn dó jǐ ce ɔ́ nyí nǔ yǎyá ǎ: é nyɔ́ wa ɔ́, un wa azɔ̌ hú mɛsɛ́dó ɖě lɛ́ɛ bǐ. È nǎ ɖɔ nǔgbó ɔ́, é nyí nyɛ wɛ ɖo azɔ̌ wa wɛ ǎ; lo ɔ́, nyɔ̌ná Mawu tɔn e ɖo kpɔ́ xá mì ɔ́ wɛ. "
"Whether, then, it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, ényí nyɛ wɛ jlá Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ mi oo, abǐ yědɛɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ jlá mi oo, Wɛn Ɖagbe e jlá wɛ mǐ ɖe ɔ́ nɛ́; nǔ e mi ka ɖi nǔ ná ɔ́ nɛ́. "
"But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? ","Mǐ ɖo jlǎjlá wɛ ɖɔ Mawu fɔ́n Klísu sín kú; ée é nyí mɔ̌ ɔ́, nɛ̌ mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ ka ná ɖo mi mɛ, bó ná sixú ɖɔ mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ kún ná fɔ́n ó gbɔn? "
"If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. ","Ényí mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ ma nɔ fɔ́n nǔgbó ǎ hǔn, Klísu lɔmɔ̌ fɔ́n sín kú ǎ nɛ́. "
"And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. ","Ényí Klísu ma ka fɔ́n sín kú ǎ hǔn, Wɛn Ɖagbe e jlá wɛ mǐ ɖe ɔ́, nǔ yǎyá wɛ, bɔ nǔ e mi lɔmɔ̌ ɖi é ka nyí nǔ yǎyá. "
"More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. ","Ényí mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ má nɔ́ fɔ́n nǔgbó ǎ ɔ́, è nǎ mɔ mǐ dó mɔ kúnnu-agɔɖenúmawutɔ́; ɖó mǐ ɖe kúnnu n'i ɖɔ é fɔ́n Klísu sín kú; ényí mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ ma nɔ́ fɔ́n ǎ ɔ́, hǔn nǔ nyí mɔ̌ ǎ nɛ́. "
"For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. ","Đó nú mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ ma nɔ fɔ́n sín kú ǎ hǔn, Klísu lɔ fɔ́n sín kú ǎ nɛ́. "
"And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. ","Ényí Klísu ma ka fɔ́n sín kú ǎ hǔn, nǔɖiɖi mitɔn ɔ́, nǔ yǎyá wɛ é nyí, bɔ mi lɛ́ kpo ɖo hwɛ mitɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ. "
Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. ,"Ényí Klísu ma ka fɔ́n sín kú ǎ hǔn, nɔví ɖo Klísu mɛ e kú lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, yě lɔmɔ̌ dɔn. "
"If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied more than all men. ","Ényí nukún e ɖó Klísu wɛ mǐ ɖe ɔ́, gbɛ élɔ́ mɛ kɛ́ɖɛ́ jɛ́n é nyɔ́ ná ɔ́, nǔ mǐtɔn ná blá wǔ hú gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ tɔn. "
"But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, Klísu wɛ nyí mɛ nukɔntɔn e fɔ́n sín kú é, bó dó ná gǎnjɛwú mǐ ɖɔ mɛ e kú lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌ ná fɔ́n. "
"For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. ","Đó lě e kú gbɔn gbɛtɔ́ ɖokpó jí wá ɔ́, mɔ̌ jɛ́n fínfɔ́n sín kú mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ tɔn gbɔn gbɛtɔ́ ɖokpó jí wá é nɛ́. "
"For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. ","Lě e gbɛtɔ́ bǐ nɔ kú ɖó bǔ e yě ɖe xá Adámu ɔ́ wútu ɔ́, mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, mɛ e ɖo bǔ xá Klísu lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɔ́, Mawu ná fɔ́n yě sín kú. "
"But each in his own turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him. ","Amɔ̌, mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó ná nɔ tɛn é ɖésúnɔ tɔn mɛ; Klísu wɛ jɛ nukɔn nú mɛ bǐ, bɔ mɛ e nyí étɔn lɛ́ɛ ná bɔ dó wǔ tɔn hwenu e é ná wá dó é. "
"Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power. ","Klísu ná gblé gbɛ dó nú gǎn lɛ́ɛ bǐ, bó ná gbídí acɛkpikpa lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpó hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n e ɖo yɛswímɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpó, bó ná sɔ́ axɔ́súɖuɖu ɔ́ dó alɔ mɛ nú Mawu Tɔ́ ɔ́. Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, gbɛ ná vɔ. "
For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. ,"Đó Klísu ɖó ná ɖo axɔ́sú ɖu wɛ káká bɔ Mawu ná ɖu ɖo kɛntɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ jǐ, bó ná bɛ́ yě dó afɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ glɔ́. "
The last enemy to be destroyed is death. ,Kɛntɔ́ gúdo tɔn e sín kún è nǎ sú dó ɔ́ wɛ nyí kú. 
"For he “has put everything under his feet.” Now when it says that “everything” has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Mawu bɛ̌ nǔ bǐ dó afɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ glɔ́.” Lo ɔ́, è ɖǒ ná mɔ nukúnnú jɛ wú ɖɔ “nǔ bǐ” énɛ́ e è ɖɔ ɔ́, Mawu e sɔ́ nǔ bǐ dó Klísu glɔ́ ɔ́ kún ɖ'é mɛ ó. "
"When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all. ","Hwenu e Mawu ná hwíhwɛ́ nǔ bǐ ɖó Klísu glɔ́ ɔ́, é ɖésú Vǐ ɔ́ ná hwíhwɛ́ éɖée dó Mawu e hwíhwɛ́ nǔ bǐ dó glɔ́ tɔn ɔ́ glɔ́; énɛ́ ɔ́, Mawu ná nyí nǔ bǐ nú mɛ bǐ. "
"Now if there is no resurrection, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them? ","Mi lɛ kpɔ́n nǔ dó yě mɛ e nɔ lɛ yɛhwesin dó mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ tamɛ lɛ́ɛ wú; ényí mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ ma nɔ fɔ́n nǔgbó ǎ ɔ́, ani ɖó nukún wɛ yě mɛ e nɔ wa mɔ̌ lɛ́ɛ ka ɖe? Aniwú yě ká nɔ lɛ yɛhwesin ɖó ta yětɔn mɛ? "
"And as for us, why do we endanger ourselves every hour? ","Bɔ mǐ lɔmɔ̌, aniwú mǐ ka nɔ jó miɖée dó nú afɔkú hwebǐnu? "
"I die every day–I mean that, brothers–just as surely as I glory over you in Christ Jesus our Lord. ","Nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, ayǐhɔ́ngbe ayǐhɔ́ngbe ɔ́, un nɔ ɖibla kú: susu e un nɔ mɔ ɖó mi wú ɖo kɔnɖókpɔ́ e mǐ ɖó xa Aklúnɔ mǐtɔn Klísu Jezu ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́ wú wɛ un ɖo mɔ̌ ɖɔ nú mi wɛ. "
"If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for merely human reasons, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.” ","Ényí walɔ gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ tɔn wú wɛ un fun ahwan xá gběkanlin lɛ́ɛ ɖo Efɛ́zi fí ɔ́, le tɛ́ ká ɖ'é mɛ nú mì? Ényí mɛkúkú ma nɔ fɔ́n ǎ hǔn, mi gbɔ bo wá nú mǐ ní bló nǔ e lǒ élɔ́ ɖɔ é: “Mǐ ní ɖu nǔ, bó nu ahan, ɖó sɔ ɔ́, mǐ ná kú.” "
Do not be misled: “Bad company corrupts good character.” ,"Mi ma blɛ́ miɖée ó: “Gbɛ̌ nyanya lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, walɔ ɖagbe e è ɖǒ ɔ́ wɛ yě nɔ hɛn gblé.” "
"Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God–I say this to your shame. ","Mi byɔ́ miɖée mɛ lě e é jɛ xá gbɔn é, bó gɔn hwɛ hu. Mɛ ɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖo mi mɛ, bó tunwun Mawu ǎ; winnyá ní hu mi. "
"But someone may ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?” ",Mɛ ɖé ka kanbyɔ́ ɖɔ: “Nɛ̌ è ka ná fɔ́n mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ gbɔn? Agbaza alɔkpa tɛ́ wɛ yě ná ɖó?” 
How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. ,"Xlonɔ wɛ nú we! Nú a sɔ́ jinukún ɖé dó kɔ́ glɔ́ ɔ́, nú jinukún énɛ́ ma kú ǎ ɔ́, é sixú ná gbɛ atín ǎ. "
"When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else. ","Jinukún yǎyá ɖé kpowun wɛ a sɔ́ dó kɔ́ glɔ́; é sixú nyí jinukún e nɔ ná yovólinfín é, abǐ jinukún alɔkpa ɖěvo; é nyí agbaza e jinukún ɔ́ ná ɖe tɔ́n ɔ́ wɛ a sɔ́ dó kɔ́ glɔ́ ǎ. "
"But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body. ",Mawu ná agbaza e jló e ɔ́ jinukún énɛ́
"All flesh is not the same: Men have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another. ","Agbaza lɛ́ɛ bǐ nyí nukún mɛ ɖokpó ɔ́ ǎ; gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖó agbaza alɔkpa vo; kanlin lɛ́ɛ ɖó alɔkpa ɖěvo; xɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖó alɔkpa ɖěvo, bɔ hweví lɛ́ɛ ɖó alɔkpa ɖěvo. "
"There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another. ","Agbaza sɛ́xwé tɔn lɛ́ɛ lɔ tíin, bɔ ayǐkúngban jí tɔn lɛ́ɛ lɔ tíin; agbaza sɛ́xwé tɔn lɛ́ɛ sín ɖɛkpɛ gbɔn vo nú agbaza ayǐkúngban jí tɔn lɛ́ɛ. "
"The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor. ","Hwesivɔ́ ɖó ɖɛkpɛ é ɖésúnɔ tɔn; sun ɖó ɖɛkpɛ é ɖésú tɔn vo; sunví lɛ́ɛ ɖó yětɔn vo; ɖo sunví lɛ́ɛ ɖésú tɛ́ntin ɔ́, sunví ɖě sín ɖɛkpɛ nɔ gbɔn vo nú ɖě tɔn. "
"So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; ","Hwenu e mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ ná fɔ́n ɔ́, lě e é ná nyí gbɔn ɔ́ nɛ́. Hwenu e è sɔ́ agbaza ɔ́ dó kɔ́ glɔ́ ɔ́, nǔ nyinyɔ wɛ é kó nyí; hwenu e é ka ná lɛ́ wá gbɛ ɔ́, é sɔ́ ná nyí nǔ nyinyɔ ǎ. "
"it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; ","Hwenu e è sɔ́ ɛ dó kɔ́ glɔ́ ɔ́, é ná nylá kan; é ná ɖó gǎn ɖé ǎ; hwenu e é ka ná fɔ́n sín kú ɔ́, é ná nyɔ́ ɖɛkpɛ, bó ná ɖó hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n. "
"it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. ","Hwenu e è sɔ́ ɛ dó kɔ́ glɔ́ ɔ́, agbaza ayǐkúngban jí tɔn wɛ é nyí; hwenu e é ka ná fɔ́n sín kú ɔ́, agbaza sɛ́xwé tɔn wɛ é ná nyí. Ée agbaza ayǐkúngban jí tɔn tíin ɔ́, agbaza sɛ́xwé tɔn lɔ ɖó ná tíin. "
"So it is written: “The first man Adam became a living being” ; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Adámu e nyí gbɛtɔ́ nukɔntɔn ɔ́, húzú mɛ gbɛɖe”; Adámu gúdo tɔn ɔ́, yɛ e nɔ ná gbɛ mɛ é wɛ. "
"The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual. ","Nǔ e nyí Yɛsinsɛn tɔn ɔ́ wɛ wá dó nukɔn ǎ, ayǐkúngban jí tɔn ɔ́ wɛ jɛ nukɔn, bɔ Yɛsinsɛn tɔn ɔ́ nyí wegɔ́ ɔ́. "
"The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven. ","Gbɛtɔ́ nukɔntɔn ɔ́, kɔ́gúdu ayǐkúngban jí tɔn wɛ è dǒ bló e ná; gbɛtɔ́ wegɔ́ ɔ́ ka gosín sɛ́xwé. "
"As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the man from heaven, so also are those who are of heaven. ",Mɛ e nyí ayǐkúngban jí tɔn lɛ́ɛ cí mɛ e è sɔ́ kɔ́ dó bló ná é ɖɔhun
"And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so shall we bear the likeness of the man from heaven. ","Lě e mǐ cí mɛ e è sɔ́ kɔ́ dó bló ná ɔ́ ɖɔhun ɔ́, mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́ wɛ mǐ ná wá cí mɛ e gosín sɛ́xwé ɔ́ ɖɔhun. "
"I declare to you, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. ","Nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, nǔ e ɖɔ gbé un ja ɔ́ ɖíe: nǔ e è sɔ́ agbaza kpódó hun kpó dó bló ɔ́ sixú ɖó mǐmá ɖo axɔ́súɖuɖu Mawu tɔn mɛ ǎ; nǔ e nɔ kú ɔ́ sixú nyí jɔmakú ǎ. "
"Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed– ","Mi ɖótó! Un ná ɖe nǔbúdo ɖokpó xlɛ́ mi; mǐ bǐ ná kú ǎ, amɔ̌ è nǎ húzú mǐ bǐ, "
"in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. ","ɖo cɛ́jú mɛ, ɖo nukún xwixwe ɖokpó mɛ, hwenu e kpɛn gǔdo gúdo tɔn ɔ́ ná ɖɔ nǔ é; ɖó hwenu e kpɛn ɔ́ ná ɖɔ nǔ ɔ́, mɛ e kú lɛ́ɛ ná fɔ́n, bó ná nyí mɛ e ma sɔ́ ɖó ná kú ǎ é, bɔ è nǎ húzú mǐ bǐ. "
"For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, agbaza e nɔ nyɔ ɔ́ ɖó ná sɔ́ ée ma nɔ nyɔ ǎ ɔ́ dó; agbaza e nɔ kú ɔ́ ɖó ná sɔ́ ée ma sixú kú ǎ ɔ́ dó. "
"When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.” ","Hwenu e agbaza e nɔ nyɔ́ ɔ́ ná sɔ́ ée ma nɔ́ nyɔ́ ǎ ɔ́ dó, bɔ agbaza e nɔ kú ɔ́ ná sɔ́ ée ma sixú kú ǎ ɔ́ dó ɔ́, hwe énɛ́ ɔ́ nu ɔ́, xó élɔ́ e Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ ɔ́ ná jɛ: “È sú kú sín kún dó; è ɖu ɖo kú jí bǐ kpéte!” "
"“Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?” ","Mawuxówéma ɔ́ lɛ́ ɖɔ: “Kú, fítɛ́ ɖuɖéjí towe ɖe? Kú, fítɛ́ acɛ towe e a nɔ dó wa nǔ nyanya ná ɔ́ ɖe?” "
"The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. ","Kú nɔ yí acɛ tɔn e é nɔ dó wa nǔ nyanya ná ɔ́ ɖo hwɛhuhu sí, bɔ hwɛhuhu ka nɔ yí acɛ tɔn ɖo sɛ́n sí. "
But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. ,"Lo ɔ́, susu nú Mawu e nɔ ná ɖuɖéjí mǐ gbɔn Aklúnɔ mǐtɔn Jezu Klísu jí é! "
"Therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.Now about the collection for God's people: Do what I told the Galatian churches to do. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, nɔví ce vívɛ́ná lɛ́ɛ mi, mi syɛ́nlǐn, bó lí dǒ, lobo nɔ ɖo bǐbí dó Aklúnɔ sín azɔ̌ ɔ́ wú d'é jí wɛ ayǐhɔ́ngbe ayǐhɔ́ngbe; ɖó mi tunwun ɖɔ azɔ̌ e wa wɛ mi ɖe ɖo bǔ e mi ɖe xá Aklúnɔ mɛ ɔ́ kún ná gú mi ó.Un ná lɛ́ ɖɔ xó kpɛɖé nú mi dó akwɛ́ e è nɔ jɔ dó mɛɖeɖóvo Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ tamɛ ɔ́ wú: mi wa nǔ bónú é ní sɔgbe xá lě e un ɖɔ nú agun e ɖo Galatinu lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ yě ní bló gbɔn é.

"On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with his income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will have to be made.

"For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, lě e mǐ ji ya gěgé xá Klísu gbɔn ɔ́, mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́ jɛ́n Mawu na dó gbɔ gěgé nú mǐ gbɔn Klísu jí. "
"If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer. ","Ényí mǐ ɖo ya ji wɛ ɔ́, è nǎ dó gbɔ nú mi, bó ná hwlɛ́n mi gán wú wɛ; ényí è dǒ gbɔ nú mǐ ɔ́, è nǎ dó gbɔ nú mi wútu wɛ.

"And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, nukún e ɖó mi wɛ mǐ ɖe ɔ́ syɛ́n ɖésú. Đó mǐ tunwun ɖɔ ée wǔvɛ́ e mɔ wɛ mǐ ɖe ɔ́ mɔ wɛ mi lɔ ɖe é ɔ́, gbɔ e è dó nú mǐ ɔ́, è nǎ dó nú mi lɔmɔ̌. "
"We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about the hardships we suffered in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired even of life. ","Nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, nǔgbó ɔ́, mǐ jlǒ nú mi ní tunwun wǔvɛ́ e mǐ mɔ ɖo tokpɔn Azíi tɔn mɛ é: agban tɔn kpɛn mǐ sɔ mɔ̌, káká bɔ mǐ sɔ́ sixú dɛ ɖ'é nu ǎ; mǐ sɔ́ ɖó nukún lɔ ɖɔ mǐ ná nɔ gbɛ ǎ. "
"Indeed, in our hearts we felt the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead. ","Mǐ ko vɛdó ɖɔ kúhwɛ wɛ è ɖǒ nú mǐ sín; nǔ nyí mɔ̌, bó ná kplɔ́n mǐ ɖɔ mǐ ní ma nɔ ɖó jiɖiɖe dó mǐ ɖésúnɔ wú ó; lo ɔ́, mǐ ní nɔ ɖó jiɖiɖe dó Mawu e nɔ fɔ́n mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ ɔ́ kɛ́ɖɛ́ wú. "
"He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us, ","É wɛ hwlɛ́n mǐ sín afɔkú baɖabaɖa énɛ́ e hɛn ɔ́, é ná dɔn mɛ yi kú ɔ́ mɛ, bó ka ná lɛ́ hwlɛ́n mǐ sín mɛ. Nǔgbó wɛ!

as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many. ,"ɖó mi ɖésúnɔ ɔ́, mi ná dó alɔ mǐ ɖo ɖɛ e mi nɔ xo nú mǐ lɛ́ɛ gbla mɛ.

"Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, in the holiness and sincerity that are from God. We have done so not according to worldly wisdom but according to God's grace. ","Nǔ e wú mǐ hɛn ɔ́, mǐ ná gó ɔ́ ɖíe: ayixa mǐtɔn ná gǎnjɛwú mǐ ɖɔ mǐ zǎn gbɛ mǐtɔn ɖo gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ; ɖo tají ɔ́, mǐ zán gbɛ mǐtɔn ɖo tɛ́ntin mitɔn kpó ayi ɖokpó kpó, kpó nǔgbó e nɔ gosín Mawu gɔ̌n ɔ́ kpó.

"For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that, ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, ɖo wěma e mǐ nɔ sɛ́ dó mi lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɔ́, mǐ nɔ wlán nǔ ɖěvo zɛ nǔ e mi nɔ xa ɖ'é mɛ, bó nɔ mɔ nukúnnú jɛ mɛ lɛ́ɛ wú ǎ. Bɔ un ɖo nukún ɖó wɛ ɖɔ mi ná mɔ nukúnnú jɛ nǔ élɔ́ mɛ céɖécéɖé. "
"as you have understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus. ","Nǔ kpɛɖé kpowun wú jɛ́n mi mɔ nukúnnú jɛ din; é wɛ nyí ɖɔ Aklúnɔ mǐtɔn Jezu sín azǎn gbe ɔ́, mi hɛn ɔ́, mi ná xɔ susu ɖó mǐ wú, lě e mǐ lɔ ná xɔ susu ɖó mi wú gbɔn é. "
"Because I was confident of this, I planned to visit you first so that you might benefit twice. ","Un ko ɖeji dó nǔ énɛ́ wú sɔ mɔ̌, bó ko lin ɖ'ayǐ ɖɔ un ná wá mi gɔ́n, bónú Mawu ná wa ɖagbe nú mi ɖó azɔn we jí. "
"I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, un ko lin ɖ'ayǐ ɖɔ un ná gbɔn mi gɔ́n, bó ná dín yi Masedwani, bó lɛ́ kɔ ɔ́, un ná lɛ́ wá mɔ mi, bɔ mi ná dó alɔ mì, bɔ un ná dín yi Judée. "
"When I planned this, did I do it lightly? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say, “Yes, yes” and “No, no”? ","Ée un ɖo linlin énɛ́ ɖó wɛ ɔ́, nǔɖé kpowun wa wɛ un ɖe a? Hwenu e un ɖo tito ce lɛ́ɛ to wɛ ɔ́, linlin gbɛtɔ́ tɔn kɛ́ɖɛ́ wɛ un dó to yě ná a? Un ná ɖo gbesisɔ mɛ, bó ná ɖo “ɛɛn” kpó “éeǒ” kpó ɖɔ wɛ zɛ̌ɛ́n wɛ a? "
"But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not “Yes” and “No.” ","Lě e xó e Mawu ɖɔ lɛ́ɛ ɖě ma nɔ húzú ǎ gbɔn ɔ́, mɔ̌ jɛ́n nǔ e un ɖɔ nú mi ɔ́ ma nyí “ɛɛn” bo lɛ́ nyí “éeǒ” ǎ é nɛ́. "
"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by me and Silas and Timothy, was not “Yes” and “No,” but in him it has always been “Yes.” ","Đó Klísu Jezu, Mawu ví e xó nyɛ kpó Silási kpó, kpódó Timɔtée kpó, ɖɔ nú mi ɔ́ wá, bó ná nyí “ɛɛn”, bó ná lɛ́ nyí “éeǒ” ǎ. É nyɔ́ wa ɔ́, “ɛɛn” Mawu tɔn wɛ é nyí. "
"For no matter how many promises God has made, they are “Yes” in Christ. And so through him the “Amen” is spoken by us to the glory of God. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, é wɛ nyí “ɛɛn” e yí gbe ɖɔ akpá e Mawu dó lɛ́ɛ bǐ nyí nǔgbó é. Hǔn Klísu Jezu jí wɛ mǐ nɔ́ ɖɔ “amǐ” mǐtɔn gbɔn, bó ná dó kpa susu nú Mawu. "
"Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us, ",Bɔ Mawu ɖésúnɔ wɛ nɔ ná lǐnsyɛ́nsyɛ́n mǐ kpó mi kpó ɖo gbɛ e mǐ nɔ́ zán ɖo Klísu mɛ é mɛ. Mawu ɖésúnɔ wɛ ɖe mǐ ɖó vo. 
"set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come. ","É wɛ sɔ́ nyǐkɔ tɔn dó ɖó wuntun mǐ, bó kɔn Yɛsinsɛn dó ayi mǐtɔn mɛ; é wɛ ná gǎnjɛwú mǐ ɖɔ mǐ ná mɔ ɖagbe e é sɔ́ ɖ'ayǐ nú mǐ lɛ́ɛ yí. "
I call God as my witness that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth. ,"Mawu ná ɖe kúnnu nú mì; ényí nǔvú ɖó wɛ un ɖe hǔn, ma kú. Un jló ná gba ayi dó nú mi ǎ wútu wɛ un ma lɛ́ kɔ wá Kɔlɛ́nti ǎ. "
"Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, because it is by faith you stand firm.So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you. ","Mǐ ba ná ɖɔ nú mi ɖɔ nǔ lě wɛ mi ɖó ná ɖi nǔ ná dandan ǎ, ɖó mi ko lí dǒ ɖo nǔɖiɖi mɛ; lo ɔ́, mǐ jló ná wa azɔ̌ xá mi nú nyɔ̌ná mitɔn.Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ, un ɖɔ un kún sɔ́ ná wá mi gɔ́n ó, ɖó un táá lɛ́ dɔn mi dó aluwɛ mɛ. "
"For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved? ","Đó ényí un dɔn mi dó aluwɛ mɛ ɔ́, mɛ̌ ka ná lɛ́ dó xomɛhunhun nú mì? Mi mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ e un ná ko dɔn dó aluwɛ mɛ lɛ́ɛ kɛ́ɖɛ́ jɛ́n ná nyí! "
"I wrote as I did so that when I came I should not be distressed by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ un wlán wěma sɛ́ dó mi lě e un bló gbɔn é: un jló ná wá mi gɔ́n bónú yě mɛ ɖokpó e ɖó ná dó xomɛhunhun nú mì lɛ́ɛ ná dɔn mì dó aluwɛ mɛ ǎ. Nǔgbó ɔ́, un ɖó gǎnjɛwú ɖɔ hwenu e xomɛ nɔ ɖo hunhun mì wɛ ɔ́, mi lɔmɔ̌ ɔ́, mi bǐ wɛ xomɛ nɔ hun. "
"For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you. ","Nǔgbó wɛ, un wlán wěma sɛ́ dó mi kpódó ayixa gbadó kpó, kpó vǐvɛ́ sise kpó, kpódó avǐ ya ma xwɛ kpán; é ka nyí ɖɔ un ná dó dɔn mi dó aluwɛ mɛ wútu wɛ ǎ; lo ɔ́, nú mi ná dó tunwun lě e un yí wǎn nú mi sɔ é. "
"If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you, to some extent–not to put it too severely. ","Ényí é sín mɛɖé wú bɔ è jɛ aluwɛ mɛ ɔ́, nyɛ wɛ mɛ énɛ́ dɔn dó aluwɛ mɛ ǎ; lo ɔ́, mi bǐ wɛ; abǐ nú è ma ná dó atɔ́ɔ́n nú jí ǎ ɔ́, mɛ akpá ɖé wɛ è dɔn dó aluwɛ mɛ ɖo mi mɛ. "
The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient for him. ,"Tó e mɛ gěgé ɖo mi mɛ, bó dɔn nú mɛ énɛ́ ɔ́ ko kpé. "
"Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, mi gbɔ bo sɔ́ hwɛ kɛ ɛ, bó dó gbɔ n'i, bónú é ma yí jɛ aluwɛ ɖaxó ɖé mɛ, bó ná mɔ ɖɔ nǔ bǐ ko vɔ ó. "
"I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him. ","Hǔn, un ɖo byɔ̌byɔ́ mi wɛ ɖɔ mi ní ɖe xlɛ́ ɛ ɖɔ émí yí wǎn n'i. "
The reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything. ,"Nǔgbó ɔ́, nǔ e wú un wlán wěma sɛ́ dó mi ɔ́ ɖíe: un jló ná tɛ́n mi kpɔ́n, bó ná kpɔ́n ɖɔ mi ɖo gbesisɔ mɛ hwebǐnu, bó ná bló nǔ e un ɖɔ nú mi lɛ́ɛ ají. "
"If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And what I have forgiven–if there was anything to forgive–I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake, ","Nú mɛɖé wa nǔ nyi do, bónú mi sɔ́ kɛ ɛ ɔ́, nyi lɔ nɔ sɔ́ kɛ ɛ; ɖó ényí un sɔ́ hwɛ kɛ mɛ ɔ́, midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ wú wɛ un sɔ́ kɛ ɛ ɖo Klísu nukɔn, "
in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes. ,"bónú Satáan ní ma kpé mǐ wú ó; nǔgbó ɔ́, mǐ tunwun linlin tɔn lɛ́ɛ ganjí. "
"Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me, ","Hwenu e un wá Tlowasi, bó ná jlá Wɛn Ɖagbe e ɖɔ xó dó Klísu wú é ɔ́, un mɔ ɖɔ Aklúnɔ bló bɔ azɔ̌ ɔ́ sín ali ɖagbe ɖé hun nú mì ɖo fínɛ́. "
"I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said good-by to them and went on to Macedonia. ","É ka ɖo mɔ̌ có wǔ kú mì ɖaxó tlala, ɖó un ko mɔ nɔví mǐtɔn Títu ǎ. Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ un ɖɔ nú Tlowasinu lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ é yi hweɖénu, bó ɖidó Masedwani. "
"But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him. ","Lo ɔ́, susu nú Mawu, ɖó é nɔ dɔn mǐ hwebǐnu, bɔ mǐ ɖo gúdo tɔn ɖo ɖuɖéjíhwan e mɛ mǐ ɖo bǔ xá Klísu ɖe ɔ́ mɛ.

For we are to God the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing. ,"Nǔgbó ɔ́, mǐ cí zǎlínkpɔ́n wǎnɖagbenɔ ɖé ɖɔhun, bɔ Klísu zé ná Mawu; mǐ nyǐ zǎlínkpɔ́n wǎnɖagbenɔ nú mɛ e ɖo hwlɛngán sín ali jí lɛ́ɛ é, bó lɛ́ nyí nú mɛ e ɖo bǔbú wɛ lɛ́ɛ é. "
"To the one we are the smell of death; to the other, the fragrance of life. And who is equal to such a task? ","Amɔ̌, wǎn e nɔ hu mɛ ɔ́ wɛ mǐ nyí nú mɛ e ɖo bǔbú wɛ lɛ́ɛ, bó ka nyí wǎn e nɔ ná gbɛ mɛ ɔ́ nú mɛ e ɖo hwlɛngán sín ali jí lɛ́ɛ é. Mɛ̌ ka sixú kpé azɔ̌ mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn wú bó wa? "
"Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, like men sent from God.Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you? ","Mǐ cí mɛ tobutóbú e nɔ zé Mawuxó ɔ́ dó wa ajɔ̌ ná lɛ́ɛ ɖɔhun ǎ.

"You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everybody. ","Midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖésúnɔ wɛ nyí wěma mǐtɔn, bɔ è wlán dó ayixa mɛ nú mǐ, bɔ mɛ bǐ hɛn ɔ́, yě nǎ tunwun, bó ná xa. "
"You show that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts. ","Nǔgbó wɛ! É ɖo wɛn ɖɔ wěma ɖé wɛ mi nyí, bɔ Klísu wlán, bɔ mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ nɔ sɔ́ jó.

Such confidence as this is ours through Christ before God. ,Jiɖiɖe e mǐ ɖó dó Mawu wú gbɔn Klísu jí ɔ́ wɛ zɔ́n bɔ mǐ yí gbe ɖɔ mɔ̌ wɛ é nyí. 
"Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, gbɔn alɔkpa ɖěbǔ mɛ ɔ́, mǐ sixú ɖɔ ɖɔ mǐ sixú wa azɔ̌ mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn ɖo mǐ ɖésúnɔ sín hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n mɛ ǎ. Hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n e mǐ nɔ dó kpé nǔ wú ɔ́, Mawu gɔ́n wɛ é nɔ gosín. "
"He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant–not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. ","Đó é wɛ húzú mǐ, bɔ mǐ kpé wú, bó nyí akɔjijɛ yɔ̌yɔ́ ɔ́ sín azɔ̌watɔ́. Akɔjijɛ yɔ̌yɔ́ énɛ́ jínjɔ́n sɛ́n e è wlán lɛ́ɛ jí ǎ; lo ɔ́, Yɛsinsɛn sín nǔwiwa wɛ. Sɛ́n e è wlán ɔ́, mɛ wɛ é nɔ hu; lo ɔ́ Yɛsinsɛn ɔ́, gbɛ wɛ é nɔ ná mɛ. "
"Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, fading though it was, ","Sɛ́n ɔ́, awǐnnya sín atɛ lɛ́ɛ jí wɛ è wlǎn ɖó, wěkwín ɖě jɛ ɖě gúdo, bɔ susu Mawu tɔn tɔ́n hwe énɛ́ nu.

will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious? ,nɛ̌ wɛ susu e lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó Yɛsinsɛn sín azɔ̌ ɔ́ ma ɖó ná d'agba hú mɔ̌ ǎ gbɔn? 
"If the ministry that condemns men is glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness! ",Azɔ̌ e nɔ dɔn gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ yi kú ɔ́ ko ɖó susu
For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory. ,Mǐ sixú ɖɔ ɖɔ susu e jɛ kínkɔ́n jí ɖ'ayǐ ɔ́ kún nyí nǔtí ɖo susu din tɔn ɔ́ nukɔn ó
"And if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts! ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, ényí nǔ e ná nɔ ayǐ nú hwenu kpɛɖé ɔ́ ka xɔ susu ɔ́, nɛ̌ wɛ ée ná nɔ ayǐ káká sɔ́yi ɔ́ ma ká ná xɔ susu hú mɔ̌ ǎ gbɔn? "
"Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold. ",Nukúnɖíɖó mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn e mǐ ɖó ɔ́ wú wɛ mǐ ɖó jiɖiɖe sɔ mɔ̌. 
"We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at it while the radiance was fading away. ","Mǐ cí Mɔyízi ɖɔhun ǎ; éyɛ́ ɔ́, avɔ wɛ é cyɔ́n nukún mɛ, bónú Izlayɛ́li ví lɛ́ɛ ní ma mɔ wěziza e ɖo kínkɔ́n wɛ ɖo nukún tɔn mɛ, bó ka ná bú ɔ́ sín yiyi ó. "
"But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away. ","Lo ɔ́, è cyɔ́n nǔ ayixa yětɔn jí, bɔ ayixa yětɔn sɔ́ sixú nɔ mɔ nǔ ǎ; bɔ káká jɛ din ɔ́, nú yě ɖo nǔ xa wɛ ɖo akɔjijɛ xóxó ɔ́ wéma mɛ ɔ́, avɔ ɖokpó ɔ́ wɛ nɔ cyɔ́n ayixa yětɔn jí. Mɛ e ɖo bǔ xá Klísu ɔ́ sín ayixa jí jɛ́n wɛ è nɔ ɖe avɔ énɛ́ sín. "
"Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts. ","Káká jɛ égbé ɖésú ɔ́, nú yě ɖo Mɔyízi sín wěma lɛ́ɛ xa wɛ hweɖěbǔnu ɔ́, avɔ ɔ́ nɔ cyɔ́n ayixa yětɔn jí. "
"But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. ","Lo ɔ́, lě e Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ gbɔn ɔ́ ɖíe: “Ényí mɛɖé lɛ́ kɔ wá Aklúnɔ gɔ́n ɔ́, è nɔ ɖe avɔ ɔ́ síin.” "
"Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. ","Lo ɔ́, Aklúnɔ e xó ɖɔ wɛ è ɖe ɖo fí ɔ́, Yɛ ɔ́ wɛ; bɔ fí e Yɛ Aklúnɔ tɔn ka ɖe ɔ́, mɛɖée sí jijɛ ɖo fínɛ́. "
"And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.Therefore, since through God's mercy we have this ministry, we do not lose heart. ","Mǐ bǐ ɔ́, è ɖe avɔ sín nukún mɛ nú mǐ, bɔ susu Aklúnɔ tɔn ɔ́, è nɔ mɔ ɖo mǐ mɛ wěkpɛ́n mɛ ɖɔhun; énɛ́ ɔ́, è húzú mǐ nú mǐ ná cí Aklúnɔ ɖɔhun, bɔ mǐ gosín susu ɖé mɛ yi byɔ́ susu e lɛ́ hú gǎn mɔ̌ é mɛ.

"Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. ","Nǔglɔ́nú e mǐ nɔ wa lɛ́ɛ kpó winnyánú e mǐ nɔ́ wa lɛ́ɛ kpó ɔ́, mǐ jó dó; mǐ nɔ sɔ́ sísɛ́ ɖó nukɔn dó wa nǔ ǎ; mǐ nɔ́ kpé ta do nú Mawuxó ɔ́ ǎ; é nyɔ́ wa ɔ́, mǐ nɔ́ ɖɔ nǔgbó ɔ́ nyi wɛn nú mɛ, bɔ è nɔ tunwun; énɛ́ ɔ́, gbɛtɔ́ bǐ nɔ mɔ ɖo ayi mɛ ɖo Mawu nukɔn ɖɔ azɔ̌ mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn wa tɔ́ wɛ mǐ nyí. "
"And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. ","Nú Wɛn Ɖagbe e jlá wɛ mǐ ɖe ɔ́ dó zǐnflú ɔ́, mɛ e ɖo dindɔn wɛ lɛ́ɛ jɛ́n é dó zǐnflú ná. "
"The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. ",Yě ɖi nǔ ǎ
"For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, mǐ ɖésúnɔ jlá wɛ mǐ ɖe ǎ: Klísu Jezu jlá wɛ mǐ ɖe ɖɔ é nyí Aklúnɔ, bó ɖo mǐɖée jlá wɛ ɖɔ mɛsɛntɔ́ mitɔn wɛ mǐ nyí ɖó Jezu wú. "
"For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ. ","Mawu e ɖɔ: “Wěziza ní kɔ́n sín ablu mɛ” ɔ́, é ɖokpó ɔ́ wɛ lɛ́ nyí mɛ e bló bɔ wěziza tɔn nɔ kɔ́n ɖo ayi mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ é, bónú mǐ ná ɖó nǔnywɛ́ wěziza tɔn e nyí susu Mawu tɔn é; susu Mawu tɔn e ɖo kínkɔ́n wɛ ɖo Klísu sín nukún mɛ é. "
But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. ,"Lo ɔ́, mǐ mɛ e sí dɔkun Yɛsinsɛn tɔn énɛ́ ɖe lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, kozɛ́n ɖɔhun wɛ mǐ cí, bónú è nǎ mɔ ganjí ɖɔ hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n aditi énɛ́ ɔ́, Mawu tɔn wɛ; é kún nyí mǐtɔn ó. "
"We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; ","Nǔgbomɛ alɔkpa alɔkpa lɛ́ɛ nɔ ɖo go ján dó mǐ wɛ; lo ɔ́, yě nyínyɛ́ mǐ ǎ; mǐ sɔ́ tunwun lě e mǐ ná wa nǔ gbɔn ɔ́ ǎ; lo ɔ́, mǐ mɔ ɖɔ nǔ bǐ ko vɔ ǎ. "
"persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed. ","È ɖo ya dó nú mǐ wɛ; lo ɔ́, Mawu jó mǐ dó ǎ; è nɔ ɖo mǐ zín dó ayǐ wɛ, mǐ ka dɔn ǎ. "
"We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body. ","Kú Jezu tɔn ɔ́ ɖo agbaza mǐtɔn mɛ bɔ mǐ kpó é kpó ɖo yiyi wɛ tɛgbɛ, bónú gbɛ tɔn lɔ ná ɖe éɖée xlɛ́ ɖo agbaza mǐtɔn mɛ. "
"For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that his life may be revealed in our mortal body. ","Gbɛ mǐtɔn mɛ ɔ́, è ɖo kúdán gblɔ́n nú mǐ wɛ tɛgbɛ ɖó Jezu wú, nú gbɛ tɔn lɔ ná ɖe éɖée xlɛ́ ɖo agbaza mǐtɔn e ɖo te nú kú ɔ́ mɛ. "
"So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, kú ɔ́ ɖo azɔ̌ wa wɛ ɖo mǐ mɛ; gbɛ lɔ ka ɖo azɔ̌ wa wɛ ɖo mi mɛ. "
"It is written: “I believed; therefore I have spoken.” With that same spirit of faith we also believe and therefore speak, ","Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Un ɖi nǔ, énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ un ɖɔ xó.” Đo nǔɖiɖi sín ayixa ɖokpó ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, mǐ lɔ ɖi nǔ; énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ mǐ ɖo xó ɖɔ wɛ. "
because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you in his presence. ,"Nǔgbó ɔ́, mǐ tunwun ɖɔ Mawu e fɔ́n Aklúnɔ Jezu sín kú wá gbɛ ɔ́ ná fɔ́n mǐ lɔmɔ̌ wá gbɛ kpó Jezu kpó, bó ná bló bɔ mǐ kpó mi kpó ná wá nukɔn tɔn. "
"All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God. ","Đagbe mitɔn wútu wɛ nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ jɛ; énɛ́ ɔ́, mɛ e jí kɔn nyi wɛ fɛ́nú Mawu tɔn ɖe lɛ́ɛ ná nɔ́ ɖo jijɛ jí wɛ, bɔ ɖɛ e mɛ gěgé ná nɔ́ xo dó dó kú nú Mawu ɔ́ ná nɔ́ ɖo jijɛ jí wɛ ayǐhɔ́ngbe ayǐhɔ́ngbe nú susu Mawu tɔn. "
"Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day. ","Nǔ e wútu awakanmɛ ma nɔ kú mǐ ǎ ɔ́ nɛ́. Nú nǔ e mǐ nyǐ ɖo agbaza mɛ ɔ́ ná bo ɖo gblěgblé wɛ ɔ́, nǔ e mǐ nyí ɖo Yɛsinsɛn li jí ɔ́ nɔ ɖo hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n mɔ wɛ ayǐhɔ́ngbe ayǐhɔ́ngbe. "
For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. ,"Wǔvɛ́ kpɛ e mɔ wɛ mǐ ɖe din nú hwenu ɖé ɔ́ nɔ́ bló susu mavɔ mavɔ ɖ'ayǐ nú mǐ, bɔ é nɔ́ túnflá; susu énɛ́ ɖo tají hú wǔvɛ́ e mɔ wɛ mǐ ɖe din é ɖaxó. "
"So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.Now we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands. ","Đó nǔ e è nɔ mɔ ɖó nukún wú ɔ́ jí wɛ ayixa mǐtɔn ɖe ǎ; lo ɔ́, nǔ e è ma nɔ mɔ ɖó nukún wú ǎ ɔ́ jí wɛ ayixa mǐtɔn ɖe. Nǔ e è nɔ mɔ ɖó nukún wú ɔ́, hwenu kpɛɖé jɛ́n wɛ é nɔ́ nɔ ayǐ ná; lo ɔ́, nǔ e è ma nɔ mɔ ɖó nukún wú ǎ ɔ́, é nɔ́ nɔ ayǐ káká sɔ́yi.Nǔgbó ɔ́, mǐ tunwun ɖɔ nú è kíjá agbaza mǐtɔn e nyí goxɔ ayǐkúngban jí tɔn ɔ́, mǐ ɖó ɖěvo e nyí xɔ Mawu tɔn e gbɛtɔ́ sín alɔ ma bló ǎ, bɔ é ná nɔ ayǐ káká sɔ́yi ɔ́ ɖo sɛ́xwé. "
"Meanwhile we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling, ","Lě e mǐ ɖe din ɔ́, mǐ ɖo azɔn wɛn wɛ, ɖó mǐ ɖó jlǒ ɖaxó ɖɔ mǐ ní sɔ́ agbaza mǐtɔn sɛ́xwé tɔn ɔ́ dó. "
"because when we are clothed, we will not be found naked. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, ényí ɖɔ mǐ vɛ ko sixú sɔ́ dó ɔ́, è sɔ́ ná mɔ mǐ ɖo mɛ̌ ǎ. "
"For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. ","Nǔgbó wɛ! Káká jɛ hwenu e mǐ ná ɖo ayǐkúngban jí sín goxɔ énɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ dó ɔ́, mǐ ná ɖo azɔn wɛn wɛ, agban kpinkpɛn ɖé glɔ́ wɛ mǐ ɖe ɖɔhun.

"Now it is God who has made us for this very purpose and has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come. ","Mawu ɖésú wɛ kó bló mǐ nú mǐ ná tunwun hǔzúhúzú mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn, bó ná Yɛ tɔn mǐ, bɔ é nyí ɖagbe e é sɔ́ ɖ'ayǐ nú mǐ lɛ́ɛ sín gǎnjɛwú nú mǐ. "
Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord. ,"Hǔn akɔ́nkpinkpan gɔ́ ayi mɛ nú mǐ hwebǐnu. Mǐ tunwun ɖɔ hwenu e mǐ ko sixú kpo ɖo agbaza énɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, mǐ ɖo zɔ nú nɔtɛn Aklúnɔ tɔn. "
"We live by faith, not by sight. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, mǐ ɖo gbɛ ɔ́, nǔ e mǐ ɖi ɔ́ wú wɛ; é nyí mǐ kó mɔ ɖó nukún wú wɛ ǎ. "
"We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord. ","Akɔ́nkpinkpan gɔ́ ayi mɛ nú mǐ, bɔ nǔ e jló mǐ tawun ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ mǐ ní gosín agbaza élɔ́ mɛ, bó ná yi nɔ xwé mǐtɔn gbe, ɖo Aklúnɔ gɔ́n. "
"So we make it our goal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or away from it. ","Lo ɔ́, nú mǐ nɔ agbaza élɔ́ mɛ kpó mǐ gosín mɛ kpó ɔ́, nǔ e jló mǐ jɛ nukɔn ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ mǐ ní nyɔ́ Aklúnɔ nukún mɛ. "
"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive what is due him for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad. ","Đó mǐ bǐ ɔ́, mǐ ɖó ná wá Klísu nukɔn, bɔ é ná ɖɔ hwɛ dó mǐ, bónú mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó ná mɔ lě e é wa nǔ gbɔn hwenu e é ɖo agbaza tɔn mɛ ɔ́ sín ajɔ yí; nú nǔ ɖagbe wɛ mɛ ɔ́ wa, abǐ nǔ nyanya wɛ mɛ ɔ́ wa ɔ́, é ná mɔ ajɔ tɔn yí. "
"Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to persuade men. What we are is plain to God, and I hope it is also plain to your conscience. ","Mǐ tunwun nǔ e nyí sísí ɖó nú Aklúnɔ é, bó ɖo biba wɛ nú gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ná wá mǐtɔn jí. Mawu tunwun mǐ céɖécéɖé, bɔ un ɖi ɖɔ, ɖo ayi mi ɖésúnɔ tɔn mɛ ɔ́, mi tunwun nyɛ lɔmɔ̌. "
"We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to take pride in us, so that you can answer those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart. ","É nyí ɖɔ mǐ jló ná lɛ́ jɛ mǐɖée kpa jí ɖo mi gɔ́n wú wɛ ǎ; lo ɔ́, mǐ jló ná ná ali mi, bɔ mi ná xɔ susu ɖó mǐ wú; énɛ́ ɔ́, mi ná mɔ xósin e mi ná nɔ ná yě mɛ e nɔ sɔ́ nǔ e ɖo nukúnta lɛ́ɛ dó yí go ná, bó ma nɔ́ sɔ́ nǔ e ɖo ayi mɛ lɛ́ɛ dó yí go ná ǎ lɛ́ɛ. "
"If we are out of our mind, it is for the sake of God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you. ","Ényí tamɛmasɔgbenánɔ wɛ mǐ nyí nǔgbó ɔ́, Mawu wɛ mǐ nyí ná; lo ɔ́, nú tamɛ mǐtɔn ka sɔgbe ɔ́, mi wɛ é sɔgbe ná. "
"For Christ's love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died. ","Wǎn yíyí Klísu tɔn ɖu ɖo mǐ jí, ɖó mǐ ɖó gǎnjɛwú ɖɔ mɛ ɖokpó géé wɛ kú dó mɛ bǐ tamɛ; é wɛ nyí ɖɔ mɛ bǐ kú xá ɛ. "
"And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again. ","É kú dó mɛ bǐ tamɛ, bónú mɛ e ɖo gbɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, yě ma sɔ́ nɔ gbɛ nú yě ɖésúnɔ ó; lo ɔ́, yě ní nɔ gbɛ nú mɛ e kú dó yě tamɛ, bɔ è lɛ́ fɔ́n ɛ wá gbɛ dó yě tamɛ é. "
"So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, bɛ́ sín din ɔ́, mǐ sɔ́ nɔ sɔ́ gbɛtɔ́ sín ayixa dó kpɔ́n mɛ ɖěbǔ ná ǎ; ényí mǐ ko sɔ́ gbɛtɔ́ sín ayixa dó kpɔ́n Klísu ná ɖ'ayǐ ɔ́, mǐ sɔ́ nɔ́ zé ayixa énɛ́ ɔ́ dó kpɔ́n ɛ ná din ǎ. "
"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come! ","Hǔn ényí mɛɖé jɛ kpɔ́ xá Klísu lě tlóló ɔ́, mɛ ɔ́ nɔ húzú nǔɖíɖó yɔ̌yɔ́: nǔ e nyí xóxó ɔ́ bú, bɔ yɔ̌yɔ́ ɔ́ wá. "
"All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: ","Mawu e dó hwɛ gbɔ xá mǐ gbɔn Klísu jí ɔ́ sín azɔ̌ wɛ nyí nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ; é wɛ zé azɔ̌ dó así nú mǐ, bɔ mǐ ná dɔn mɛɖěvo lɛ́ɛ wá, bɔ é ná dó hwɛ gbɔ xá yě. "
"that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting men's sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. ","Đó Mawu kó ɖo azɔ̌ wa wɛ gbɔn Klísu jí, bó ná dó hwɛ gbɔ xá gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ; é kpɔ́n dó nǔwanyido yětɔn lɛ́ɛ wú ǎ. Hwɛdógbɔ sín azɔ̌ énɛ́ e wa wɛ é ɖe ɔ́, é sɔ́ dó así nú mǐ ɖɔ mǐ ní jlá. "
"We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God. ","Hǔn, Klísu nu ɖɔ xó dó wɛ mǐ ɖe, è ka ná ɖɔ nǔgbó ɔ́, Mawu ɖésú wɛ ɖo mi ylɔ́ wɛ gbɔn mǐ jí: mǐ ɖo vo sa nú mi wɛ, ɖo Klísu sín nyǐkɔ mɛ ɖɔ mi ní yí gbe bó dó hwɛ gbɔ xá Mawu. "
"God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.As God's fellow workers we urge you not to receive God's grace in vain. ","Klísu hu hwɛ ɖě kpɔ́n gbeɖé ǎ; amɔ̌ Mawu ɖíɖá ɛ hwɛ mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ, bónú ɖo bǔ e mǐ ɖe xá Klísu ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, mǐ ná sixú ɖu azɔ̌ e gbla mɛ Mawu sɔ́ mǐ dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ ná ɖo nukɔn tɔn ɔ́ sín le.Énɛ́ ɔ́, mǐ mɛ e ɖo azɔ̌ wa xá Mawu wɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mǐ ɖo byɔ̌byɔ́ mi wɛ ɖɔ mi ma jó fɛ́nú e mi yí ɖo Mawu sí ɔ́ dó, bónú é bú ó. "
"For he says, “In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.” I tell you, now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation. ","Đó nǔ e Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ é ɖíe: “Ée ɖagbewiwa sín hwenu su ɔ́, un se xó towe; hwlɛngánzán gbe su ɔ́, un wá gɔ́ alɔ nú we.” Xó e Mawu ɖɔ ɔ́ nɛ́. Đagbewiwa sín hwenu ɔ́ ɖíe su din e; hwlɛngán sín azǎn ɔ́ gbe ɖíe su din e. "
"We put no stumbling block in anyone's path, so that our ministry will not be discredited. ",Mǐ jló ɖɔ è ma kpé wú bó mɔ nǔ nyanya ɖé ɖɔ dó azɔ̌ mǐtɔn wú ó
"Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships and distresses; ","É nyɔ́ wa ɔ́, mǐ nɔ́ ɖe xlɛ́ ɖo nǔ bǐ mɛ ɖɔ mǐ nyí azɔ̌watɔ́ Mawu tɔn: mǐ nɔ́ ɖó suúlu ɖaxó, bó nɔ́ dɛ ɖo wǔvɛ́ lɛ́ɛ nu, bó nɔ́ dɛ ɖo nǔgbomɛ lɛ́ɛ, kpódó nǔ e nɔ́ hu ado lɛ́ɛ kpán nu.

in truthful speech and in the power of God,

"We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours from us. ","Mǐ gbɛ́ wǎn nú mi ǎ; lo ɔ́, midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ gbɛ́ wǎn nú mǐ. "
As a fair exchange–I speak as to my children–open wide your hearts also. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, un ɖo xó ɖɔ nú mi wɛ vǐ ce wɛ mi nyí ɖɔhun: linlin e mǐ ɖó dó mi wú ɔ́, mi ní ɖó dó mǐ lɔmɔ̌ wú; mi ní ɖó wǎn yíyí ɖaxó nú mǐ. "
Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? ,"Mi ma kpé nǔɖé xá mɛ e ma ɖi nǔ nú Klísu ǎ lɛ́ɛ ó: yě nyí mɛ e è nǎ kpé nǔ xá ɖé ǎ.

"“I will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.”Since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God. ","Un ná nyí tɔ́ nú mi, bɔ mi ná nyí vǐ súnnu kpó vǐ nyɔ̌nu kpó nú mì; nǔ e Aklúnɔ Nǔbǐwúkpétɔ́ ɔ́ ɖɔ ɔ́ nɛ́.”Mɛvívɛ́ná ce lɛ́ɛ mi, akpá énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ e Mawu dó ɔ́, mǐ wɛ é dó yě ná.

I do not say this to condemn you,Fon
I have great confidence in you, in all our troubles my joy knows no bounds. 
"For when we came into Macedonia, this body of ours had no rest, but we were harassed at every turn–conflicts on the outside, fears within. ","Đésú ɔ́, hwenu e mǐ wá Masedwani ɔ́, mǐ mɔ gbɔjɛ́ ɖěbǔ ǎ; mǐ mɔ wǔvɛ́ gbɔn fí bǐ: mǐ nɔ ɖo zali xá mɛɖěvo lɛ́ɛ wɛ, bó nɔ́ ɖo xɛsi ɖi wɛ ɖo ayi mɛ. "

"yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us.

"Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.

"See what this godly sorrow has produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what concern, what readiness to see justice done. At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter. ","Aluwɛ e mɛ mi nɔ ɔ́, Mawu zě dó wa azɔ̌ ná; mi bó kpɔ́n nǔ e tɔ́n sín mɛ din lɛ́ɛ é!

"So even though I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did the wrong or of the injured party, but rather that before God you could see for yourselves how devoted to us you are.

"By all this we are encouraged. In addition to our own encouragement, we were especially delighted to see how happy Titus was, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you.

"I had boasted to him about you, and you have not embarrassed me. But just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting about you to Titus has proved to be true as well. ","Un jlá ajɔ̌ nú nyɛɖée kpɛɖé ɖo gɔ̌n tɔn, ɖó mi wú, bɔ mi ka dó winnyá mǐ ǎ.

"And his affection for you is all the greater when he remembers that you were all obedient, receiving him with fear and trembling. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, nú é flín lě e mi bǐ ɖo gbesisɔ mɛ, bó ná se tónú gbɔn ɔ́, bó flín lě e mi yí i kpó xɛsi kpó, kpó sísɔ́sísɔ́ kpó gbɔn ɔ́, wǎn yíyí e é ɖó nú mi ɔ́ nɔ lɛ́ jɛjí. "
"I am glad I can have complete confidence in you.And now, brothers, we want you to know about the grace that God has given the Macedonian churches. ","Xomɛhunhun gɔ́ ayi mɛ nú mì, ɖó un hɛn ɔ́, un ná ɖeji dó mi wú ɖo nǔ bǐ mɛ.Nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, mǐ jló ɖɔ mi ní tunwun lě e fɛ́nú Mawu tɔn wa nǔ gbɔn ɖo agun e ɖo Masedwani lɛ́ɛ mɛ é. "
"Out of the most severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity. ","Nǔ gbo agunví lɛ́ɛ tawun ɖo fínɛ́, gbɔn wǔvɛ́ e yě mɔ lɛ́ɛ gbla mɛ.

"For I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability. Entirely on their own, ","Nǔgbó ɖɔ nú mi wɛ un ɖe; yě ná nǔ lě e yě kpé wú gbɔn é; yě tlɛ lɛ́ ná hú lě e yě kpé wú gbɔn ɔ́ lɔ; yě ɖésúnɔ ɖó jlǒ, "
they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints. ,"bó byɔ́ mǐ, bó dó tagba tɔn nú mǐ ɖésú, ɖɔ mǐ ní kɛnklɛ́n, bónú émí lɔ ná sɛ́ nǔ dó mɛɖeɖóvo Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ, bó ná dó dó alɔ yě. "
"And they did not do as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us in keeping with God's will. ","Yě bló hú gǎn lě e mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ lin gbɔn é; yě tó sɔ́ yěɖée jó nú Aklúnɔ hwɛ̌, bɔ énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, gbɔn jlǒ Mawu tɔn gbla mɛ ɔ́, yě sɔ́ yěɖée jó nú mǐ lɔmɔ̌. "
"So we urged Titus, since he had earlier made a beginning, to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ mǐ sa vo nú Títu ɖɔ ní wá mi gɔ́n, bó ná dlɛ́n azɔ̌ ɔ́ d'é nu lě e é kó jɛ wú gbɔn ɖ'ayǐ é, bó ná dó dɔn mi nú mi ná wa wǎn-yíyízɔ́ énɛ́ yi fó. "
"But just as you excel in everything–in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in your love for us –see that you also excel in this grace of giving. ","Mi jɛ dɔkun ɖo nǔ bǐ mɛ: mi jɛ dɔkun ɖo nǔɖiɖi mɛ, ɖo Mawuxó ɖiɖɔ mɛ, ɖo nǔtunwuntunwun mɛ, ɖo bǐbí ɖó dó nǔ wú maɖódogbó, kpódó wǎn yíyí e mi ɖó nú mǐ é kpán mɛ. Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, mǐ jló ɖɔ mi ní ɖe xlɛ́ ɖɔ émí jɛ dɔkun ɖo wǎn-yíyízɔ́ énɛ́ lɔ mɛ. "
"I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others. ","É nyí acɛ kpa nú mi wɛ un ɖe ǎ; lo ɔ́, un ɖɔ bǐbí ɖó dó azɔ̌ wǔ mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ tɔn nú mi, bó ná dó kpɔ́n ɖɔ wǎn yíyí e mi ɖó nú mǐ ɔ́ nyí wǎn yíyí nǔgbó a jí. "
"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich. ","Đó mi tunwun wǔ e Aklúnɔ mǐtɔn Jezu Klísu jɔ mi é: éyɛ́ mɛ e nyí dɔkunnɔ ɔ́, é sɔ́ éɖée dó bló wamamɔnɔ dó ta mitɔn mɛ, bó ná dó dó dɔkun nú mi gbɔn wamamɔnɔ nyínyí tɔn gbla mɛ. "
And here is my advice about what is best for you in this matter: Last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, un ná ɖɔ nǔ e un lin dó nǔ énɛ́ wú ɔ́ nú mi: é nyɔ́ nú mi ɖɔ nǔ e wa ji mi jɛ ɖo xwe ɖě ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, mi ní bló yi fó. Mi wɛ jɛ nǔ wa jí jɛ nukɔn; é ka nyí énɛ́ kɛ́ɖɛ́ mɛ wɛ mi jɛ nukɔn ɖe ǎ; lo ɔ́, xwe ɖě ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, mi lɛ́ ɖó jlǒ ɖagbe, bó ná wa nǔ. "
"Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means. ","Hǔn din ɔ́, mi bo dlɛ́n azɔ̌ énɛ́ d'é nu, bó wa yi fó; jlǒ ɖagbe e mi ɖó, bó ɖɔ émí ná wa azɔ̌ ɔ́, mi zé jlǒ ɖagbe mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn dó bló yi fó; mi bló mɔ̌ kpódó nǔ e ɖo mi sí é kpán. "
"For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what he does not have. ","Đó, nú è sɔ́ jlǒ ɖagbe dó ná nǔ mɛ ɔ́, nǔ e ɖo mɛ sí ɔ́ wɛ Mawu nɔ́ kpɔ́n, bó nɔ yí nǔníná énɛ́; é nyí nǔ e ma ɖo mɛ sí ǎ ɔ́ wɛ é nɔ kpɔ́n ǎ. "
"Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality. ","É nyí è nǎ sɔ́ nǔ e ɖo mɛ sí é bǐ ná mɛ dó dó alɔ mɛ, bó wá jɛ do tɔn ɖɔ wɛ è ɖe ǎ; lo ɔ́, mɛ e ná nǔ wɛ è ɖe é kpó mɛ kpó bǐ ná nɔ zɛ̌nzɛ̌n. "
"At the present time your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. Then there will be equality, ","Din ɔ́, nǔ ɖo mi sí ganjí, bɔ mi hɛn ɔ́, mi ná gɔ́ alɔ nú mɛ e nǔɖé hudó lɛ́ɛ. Énɛ́ ɔ́, nú nǔɖé wá hudó mi lɔmɔ̌ gbeɖé, bónú yě lɔ ɖó ganjí ɔ́, yě ná dó alɔ mi. Lě e mɛ bǐ ná nɔ zɛ̌nzɛ̌n gbɔn ɔ́ nɛ́. "
"as it is written: “He who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little.” ","Lě e nǔ e è wlán dó Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́ ɖɔ gbɔn é nɛ́; é wɛ nyí ɖɔ: “Mɛ e bɛ́ gěgé tɔn kplé ɔ́, é ɖó dín ǎ; mɛ e ka bɛ́ kpɛɖé ɔ́, é hwedó e ǎ.” "
"I thank God, who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you. ","Susu nú Mawu e sɔ́ dó ayi mɛ nú Títu, bɔ é bí dó mi wú mǐ ɖɔhun é! "
"For Titus not only welcomed our appeal, but he is coming to you with much enthusiasm and on his own initiative. ",Títu yí gbe nú nǔ e mǐ byɔ́ ɛ é
And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the gospel. ,"Mǐ sɛ́ nɔví e agun lɛ́ɛ bǐ nɔ kpa, ɖó lě e é nɔ wa Wɛn Ɖagbe jlájlázɔ́ ɔ́ gbɔn é wú ɔ́ dó, bɔ é xwedó Títu. "
"What is more, he was chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry the offering, which we administer in order to honor the Lord himself and to show our eagerness to help. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ kɛ́ɖɛ́ wɛ ǎ; nɔví mǐtɔn énɛ́ ɔ́ wɛ agun lɛ́ɛ ɖe, bɔ é ná xwedó mǐ gbɔn to lɛ́ɛ mɛ to lɛ́ɛ mɛ, bɔ mǐ ná wa wǎn-yíyízɔ́ énɛ́ ɔ́ nú susu Aklúnɔ tɔn, bó ná ɖe jlǒ e mǐ ɖó, bó ná dó alɔ mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ ɔ́ xlɛ́. "
We want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this liberal gift. ,"Mǐ ɖo nǔ bǐ bló wɛ, bónú nǔníná ɖaxó énɛ́ ɔ́, mɛɖé ma wá mɔ nǔɖé ɖɔ dó lě e mǐ zán gbɔn é wú ó. "
"For we are taking pains to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of men. ","Mǐ ba ná nɔ́ wa nǔ ɖagbe; é ka nyí nǔ e nɔ́ nyɔ́ Aklúnɔ nukún mɛ ɔ́ kɛ́ɖɛ́ wɛ mǐ ná nɔ́ bló ǎ; lo ɔ́, mǐ ná nɔ́ bló nǔ e nɔ́ nyɔ́ gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌ nukún mɛ é. "
"In addition, we are sending with them our brother who has often proved to us in many ways that he is zealous, and now even more so because of his great confidence in you. ","Mǐ sɛ́ nɔví mǐtɔn ɖěvo kpódó yě kpán dó; mǐ tɛ́n ɛ kpɔ́n gbɔn ali gěgé xo; é ka nɔ ɖe xlɛ́ hwe lɛ́ɛ bǐ nu ɖɔ émí bí dó azɔ̌ wú; amɔ̌ din ɔ́, ɖó jiɖiɖe ɖaxó e é ɖó dó mi wú ɔ́ wútu ɔ́, bǐbí ɖó dó azɔ̌ wú tɔn lɛ́ jɛjí. "
"As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you; as for our brothers, they are representatives of the churches and an honor to Christ. ","Títu ɔ́, azɔ̌gbɛ́ ce wɛ éyɛ́ nyí, bó nɔ́ wa azɔ̌ xá mì, bó ná dó dó alɔ mi. Nɔví ɖě lɛ́ɛ e xwedó e lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mɛsɛ́dó agun lɛ́ɛ tɔn wɛ yě nyí, bó ɖo azɔ̌ wa wɛ nú susu Klísu tɔn. "
"Therefore show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our pride in you, so that the churches can see it.There is no need for me to write to you about this service to the saints. ","Mi ɖe xlɛ́ yě ɖɔ mi yí wǎn nú yě nǔgbó, bónú agun lɛ́ɛ ná mɔ ɖɔ mi yí wǎn nú yě, bó ná tunwun ɖɔ ée mǐ ɖo gǔgó ɖó mi wú wɛ ɔ́, hwɛ mǐtɔn jɔ.Nǔ e è sɛ́ dó mɛɖeɖóvo Mawu tɔn e ɖo Judée lɛ́ɛ, bó dó dó alɔ yě ɔ́, é byɔ́ dandan ɖɔ ma wlán wěma sɛ́ dó mi d'é wú ǎ. "
"For I know your eagerness to help, and I have been boasting about it to the Macedonians, telling them that since last year you in Achaia were ready to give; and your enthusiasm has stirred most of them to action. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, un tunwun jlǒ ɖagbe e mi ɖó ɔ́, bó nɔ́ zé mi dó jlá ajɔ̌ ná ɖo Masedwaninu lɛ́ɛ gɔ́n, bó nɔ́ ɖɔ: “Nɔví e ɖo Akáyi lɛ́ɛ ko ɖo gbesisɔ mɛ, bó ná ná nǔ mɛ sín xwe ɖě ɔ́ mɛ ɖokpóó.” Bǐbí ɖó dó azɔ̌ wú mitɔn zɔ́n, bɔ akpakpa sɔ́ mɛ gěgé ɖo yě mɛ. "
"But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove hollow, but that you may be ready, as I said you would be. ","É ɖo mɔ̌ có, un ɖo nɔví élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ sɛ́ dó mi wɛ, bónú kpa e mǐ kpa mi ɖó nǔ énɛ́ wú ɔ́ ní ma wá nyí nǔ yǎyá ó: un jló ɖɔ mi ní ɖo gbesisɔ mɛ nǔgbó, lě e un ɖɔ gbɔn é. "
"For if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we–not to say anything about you–would be ashamed of having been so confident. ","É ma nyí mɔ̌ ǎ ɔ́, ényí Masedwaninu lɛ́ɛ kpó nyɛ kpó wá, bó má mɔ mi ɖo gbesisɔ mɛ ǎ ɔ́, winnyá ná hu mǐ ɖaxó, ɖó lě e mǐ kó ɖó ji ɖe dó mi wú sɔ́ é wútu; mi lɔ ná mɔ winnyá. "
"So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you in advance and finish the arrangements for the generous gift you had promised. Then it will be ready as a generous gift, not as one grudgingly given. ","Hǔn, un mɔ ɖɔ é ɖo dandan mɛ nú ma sa vo nú nɔví énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ yě ní wá gɔ̌n mitɔn jɛ nukɔn nú mǐ, bónú nǔníná e mi ko dó akpá tɔn, bó ná ná kpódó xomɛnyínyɔ́ kpó ɔ́, yě ná sɔ́ nǔ tɔn ɖ'ayǐ.

"Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously. ","Mi ka flín xógbe élɔ́: mɛ e dó jinukún kpɛví ɖé ɔ́, kpɛví ɖé wɛ é nɔ ya; mɛ e ka dó gěgé ɔ́, gěgé tɔn wɛ é nɔ́ ya. "
"Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. ","Hǔn, mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó ɖó ná ná nǔ mɛ lě e é lin gbɔn ɖo ayi tɔn mɛ é; ní ma ná nǔ mɛ, bónú é lɛ́ vɛ́ n'i, abǐ ní nyí dandan sín nǔ n'i ó. Đó Mawu yí wǎn nú mɛ e nɔ ná nǔ mɛ kpódó xomɛhunhun kpó é. "
"And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work. ","Mawu ɖó acɛ e ná ná nǔ ɖagbe ɖagbe tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ mi é, é ná ná mi, bɔ é ná túnflá, bónú mi ná ɖó nǔ e ɖo tají nú mi lɛ́ɛ bǐ hwebǐnu, bó ná zán, bɔ é ná lɛ́ kpo ɖo mi sí ganjí, nú azɔ̌ ɖagbe lɛ́ɛ bǐ. "
As it is written: “He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor,Fon
Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness. ,"Mawu e nɔ ná jinukún nǔkúndótɔ́, bó nɔ́ ná nǔɖuɖu, bɔ è nɔ ɖu ɔ́ ná ná jinukún e hudó mi ɔ́ bǐ mi, bó ná zɔ́n bɔ é ná su, bɔ hwɛjijɔ e mi ɖó ɔ́ ná ná sínsɛ́n gěgé. "
"You will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God. ","É ná dó dɔkun gěgé nú mi hwebǐnu, bónú mi ná sixú nɔ ɖe xlɛ́ hwɛhwɛ ɖɔ émí nɔ́ ná nǔ mɛ kpó xomɛhunhun kpó, bɔ mɛ gěgé ná nɔ́ dó kú nú Mawu ɖó nǔ e mi nɔ ná, bɔ mǐ nɔ́ sɔ́ yi jó nú yě lɛ́ɛ wú. "
This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of God's people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God. ,"Đó azɔ̌ énɛ́ e wa wɛ mi ɖe ɔ́, é nyí nǔ e hudó mɛɖeɖóvo Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ kɛ́ɖɛ́ wɛ é nɔ́ gló nú yě ǎ; lo ɔ́, é nɔ́ lɛ́ zɔ́n, bɔ kú dó nú Mawu sín ɖɛ nɔ sukpɔ́, ɖó nǔ e é wa nǔ yě lɛ́ɛ wú.

"Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, men will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else. ","Azɔ̌ énɛ́ ná ɖe nǔ e mǐ nyí ɔ́ xlɛ́, bɔ mɛ gěgé ná kpa susu nú Mawu ɖó tónú e mi se nú Mawu, bó nɔ ɖe nǔɖiɖi e mi ɖó nú Wɛn Ɖagbe Klísu tɔn ɔ́ xlɛ́ é wú; yě ná lɛ́ kpa susu nú Mawu, ɖó lě e mi nyɔ́ xomɛ, bó nɔ má dɔkun mitɔn lɛ́ɛ xá yě, kpó mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ kpó gbɔn é wú.

"Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!By the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you–I, Paul, who am “timid” when face to face with you, but “bold” when away! ","Mi nú mǐ ná dó kú nú Mawu ɖó nǔníná tɔn e d'agba bɔ è ma sixú jlɛ́ ǎ é wú.Nyɛ Pɔ́lu e è nɔ ɖɔ, nú un ɖo kpɔ́ xá mi ɔ́, un nɔ fá, un ka ɖo zɔ ɔ́ un nɔ wa adǎn sɛ́ dó mi ɔ́, nyɛ ɖésú wɛ ɖo nǔ élɔ́ byɔ́ mi wɛ; gbɔn xomɛfífá kpó xomɛnyínyɔ́ Klísu tɔn kpó mɛ ɔ́, un ɖo vo sa nú mi wɛ ɖɔ: "

so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you.

"I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him.

"But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.

"For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough. ","Đó ényí mɛɖé wá ɖɔ Jezu ɖé xó nú mi bɔ é gbɔn vo nú Jezu e xó mǐ ɖɔ nú mi ɔ́, mi nɔ xwɛ bó nɔ́ ɖótó e ganjí, bó nɔ́ lɛ́ ɖo gbesisɔ mɛ, bó ná yí yɛ kpó wɛn kpó e gbɔn vo nú Yɛ Mawu tɔn kpódó Wɛn Ɖagbe e mǐ wa jlá mi bɔ mi yí é kpán.

Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge? ,"Hwenu e un jlá Wɛn Ɖagbe Mawu tɔn ɔ́ mi ɔ́, vɔ̌nu wɛ un jlá mi; un sɔ́ nyɛɖée hwe, bó ná dó sɔ́ mi su. Ée un wa nǔ gbɔn mɔ̌ ɔ́, nǔ wɛ un wa nyi do a? "

"And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so.

And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about. ,"Un ná ɖo nǔ wa wɛ lě e bló gbɔn wɛ un ɖe din é, bɔ yě mɛ e ɖo ali ba wɛ, bó ná jlá ajɔ̌ nú yěɖée, bó ná ɖɔ émí ɖo azɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́ wa wɛ mǐ ɖɔhun lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, nǔ e wú yě ná ɖó dó ɔ́, un ná sú ali tɔn dó yě.

"In this self-confident boasting I am not talking as the Lord would, but as a fool. ","Dandan mɛ ɔ́, nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ un ɖe din ɔ́, é nyí nǔ e Aklúnɔ jló é ǎ; ɖó ninɔmɛ énɛ́ e mɛ un ɖe, bó ɖo ajɔ̌ jlá nú nyɛɖée wɛ ɔ́, un nɔ ɖɔ xó taɖunɔ wɛ un nyí ɖɔhun. "
"Since many are boasting in the way the world does, I too will boast. ","Đó mɛ gěgé ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ nɔ xwedó linlin gbɛtɔ́ tɔn kpowun, bó nɔ ɖo ajɔ̌ jlá nú yěɖée wɛ; énɛ́ wú ɔ́, nyɛ lɔmɔ̌ ná jlá ajɔ̌ nú nyɛɖée. "
You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise! ,"Tɛgbɛ jɛ́n mi nɔ yí gbe, bó nɔ ɖótó tamɛmasɔgbenánɔ lɛ́ɛ; có nǔnywɛ́tɔ́ wɛ mi ka nyí nɛ́! "
"In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or pushes himself forward or slaps you in the face.

To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that! What anyone else dares to boast about–I am speaking as a fool–I also dare to boast about. ,"Xó ɔ́, ɖiɖɔ tɔn hu winnyá: mǐ ɖe gǎnmaɖó mǐtɔn xlɛ́ dín.

"Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again. ","É ma nyí azɔ̌watɔ́ Klísu tɔn wɛ yě nyí a?

Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. ,"Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, azɔn atɔ́ɔ́n wɛ yě sɛ́n lanbá kanɖé é hwe ɖokpó (39) nú mì. "
"Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea, ","Hlɔ̌manu lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, azɔn atɔn wɛ yě ɖǒ kpo nú mì, bó nyi awǐnnyaglo bó ná dó hu mì ná azɔn ɖokpó; azɔn atɔn wɛ tɔjíhún syɔ́ dó mì; un nɔ tɔ jí nú kéze ɖokpó zǎn ɖokpó.

"I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my own countrymen, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false brothers.

I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep, I have been cold and naked. 
"Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches. ","Gɔ́ nú nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɔ́, ayǐhɔ́ngbe ayǐhɔ́ngbe ɔ́, nǔ e ɖo hǔnmɛ nú mì nú agun lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɔ́ nɔ nyí agban bó nɔ́ kpɛn mì. "
"Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn? ","Ényí mɛɖé ma ɖó gǎn ǎ ɔ́, un nɔ ɖɔ nyɛ lɔ kún ɖó gǎn ó; ényí mɛɖé jɛ hwɛ mɛ ɔ́, é nɔ nyí wǔvɛ́ ɖaxó nú mì. "

In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me. ,"Hwenu e un ɖo Damási ɔ́, tokpɔngán e ɖo azɔ̌ wa nú axɔ́sú Aletási wɛ ɔ́ fɔ sɔ́ja ɖó to ɔ́ sín hɔn lɛ́ɛ jí, bónú yě ná wlí mì. "
"But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands.I must go on boasting. Although there is nothing to be gained, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord. ","Lo ɔ́, è zě mì dó xasun mɛ, bó zé mì gbɔn flɛtɛ́li e è ɖe dó dǒ e è do xá toxo ɔ́ ná lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó nu, bɔ un jɛ te ɖo dǒ ɔ́ gúdo, bó yi; lě e un gló yě gbɔn ɔ́ nɛ́.Hǔn, un ɖó ná jlá ajɔ̌ nú nyɛɖée; có é ka nyɔ́ mɔ̌ ǎ.

I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know–God knows. ,"Un tunwun klísusɛntɔ́ ɖokpó, bɔ xwe wɛ̌nɛ ɖíe ɔ́, è sɔ́ ɛ káká yi jǐnukúnsin e yi jǐ hú jǐnukúnsin lɛ́ɛ bǐ é; un tunwun nú agbaza tɔn wɛ è sɔ́ yi abǐ lǐndɔ̌n tɔn wɛ è sɔ́ yi ǎ; Mawu ɖokpónɔ wɛ tunwun.

"And I know that this man–whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, but God knows– ","Nǔgbó wɛ! Un tunwun ɖɔ nya énɛ́ ɔ́, káká sɛ́xwé wɛ è sɔ́ ɛ yi; un lɛ́ ɖo vǐvɔ́ ɖɔ wɛ ɖɔ un kún tunwun nú agbaza tɔn wɛ è sɔ́ yi, abǐ lǐndɔ̌n tɔn wɛ è sɔ́ yi ó; Mawu ɖokpónɔ wɛ tunwun. "
"was caught up to paradise. He heard inexpressible things, things that man is not permitted to tell. ","É se xó e è ma sixú vɔ́ ɖɔ ǎ é, xó e è ma ka ná gbe gbɛtɔ́ ɖɔ ní ɖɔ ǎ é ɖo fínɛ́. "
"I will boast about a man like that, but I will not boast about myself, except about my weaknesses. ","Un ná jlá ajɔ̌ nú nyɛɖée ɖó nya énɛ́ tamɛ; lo ɔ́, un ná jlá ajɔ̌ nú nyɛɖée ɖó nyɛ ɖésúnɔ tamɛ ǎ, afi nú ma dó ɖɔ nǔ e nɔ ɖe gǎnmaɖó ce lɛ́ɛ bǐ xlɛ́ é. "
"Even if I should choose to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what I do or say. ","Ényí un jló ná jlá ajɔ̌ nú nyɛɖée ɔ́, un ná nyí taɖunɔ ǎ, ɖó xó nǔgbó wɛ un ná ɖɔ.

"To keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations, there was given me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. ","É ka ɖo mɔ̌ có, bónú goyíyí ma gɔ́ gbɛzán ce mɛ, ɖó nǔ ɖaxó ɖaxó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ e Mawu nɔ ɖe xlɛ́ mì lɛ́ɛ wútu ó ɔ́, è sɛ́ azɔn baɖabaɖa ɖé dó mì, bɔ é cí wɛnsagun Satáan tɔn ɖé ɖɔhun, bó xo mì, bó glɔ́n ali nú mì, bónú goyíyí ma gɔ́ gbɛzán ce mɛ ó.

Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. ,"Azɔn atɔn wɛ un sa vo nú Aklúnɔ, ɖɔ ní hwlɛ́n mì sín wǔvɛ́ énɛ́ mɛ. "
"But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. ","Bɔ Mawu yí gbe nú mì ɖɔ: “Wǔjɔmɛ ce wɛ nyí nǔ e hudó we ɔ́ bǐ, ɖó hwenu e a ma kpé nǔ wú ǎ ɔ́ wɛ hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n ce nɔ́ ɖe nǔwiwa tɔn lɛ́ɛ bǐ xlɛ́ dégbédégbé.” Hǔn, un ɖo gbesisɔ mɛ bó ná sɔ́ gǎnmaɖó ce dó jlá ajɔ̌ nú nyɛɖée kpó ayixa ce bǐ kpó, bónú hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n Klísu tɔn ná cyɔ́n alɔ jǐ ce.

"That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wútu ɔ́, gǎnmaɖó ce nɔ́ dó xomɛhunhun nú mì ɖó Klísu wú.

"I have made a fool of myself, but you drove me to it. I ought to have been commended by you, for I am not in the least inferior to the “super-apostles,” even though I am nothing. ","Un ɖo xó ɖɔ wɛ taɖunɔ wɛ un húzú ɖɔhun; lo ɔ́, mi wɛ zɔ́n mɔ̌; mi wɛ ná ko jɛ ahwan jǐ ce. Đó nú un ma tlɛ nyí nǔɖé ǎ ɔ́, un hwe hú mɛ e mi nɔ mɔ dó mɔ mɛsɛ́dó ɖaxó lɛ́ɛ é ɖo nǔ ɖěbǔ mɛ ǎ. "

"Now I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you, because what I want is not your possessions but you. After all, children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children. ","Nyɛ ɖíe ko lɛ́ ɖo gbesisɔ mɛ bó ja gɔ̌n mitɔn azɔn atɔngɔ́ e, un ka ná lɛ́ nyí agban bo kpɛn mi ǎ; mi ba wɛ un ɖe; akwɛ́ mitɔn ba wɛ un ɖe ǎ.

Now we pray to God that you will not do anything wrong.

Later I went to Syria and Cilicia. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, un yi Silíi, kpódó Silisíi kpán gbé jí. "
I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. ,"Káká jɛ hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, mɛ e ɖo agun Klísu tɔn mɛ ɖo Judée lɛ́ɛ ɖě kó mɔ mì kpɔ́n ǎ. "
They only heard the report: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.” ,"Yě se kpowun ɖɔ: “Mɛ e nɔ dó ya nú mǐ ɖ'ayǐ ɔ́ ɖo ɖiɖɔ nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ din ɖɔ yě ní ɖi nǔ nú Jezu. Đ'ayǐ ɔ́, é wɛ ka nɔ dó gǎn, bó ná sú mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ sín kún dó.” "
"And they praised God because of me.Fourteen years later I went up again to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas. I took Titus along also. ","Bɔ yě kpa susu nú Mawu ɖó nyɛ wútu.Xwe wɛ̌nɛ gúdo ɔ́, un lɛ́ kɔ yi Jeluzalɛ́mu, nyɛ kpódó Baanabási kpó; un lɛ́ kplá Títu lɔmɔ̌. "
"I went in response to a revelation and set before them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. But I did this privately to those who seemed to be leaders, for fear that I was running or had run my race in vain. ","Un yi dɔ̌n ɖó Mawu ɖe xlɛ́ mì ɖɔ un ɖó ná yi.

"Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek. ","Títu e kpódó nyɛ kpó zɔn ɔ́, Glɛ̌sinu wɛ; è ka ɖɔ ada jɛ́n é ná gbo dandan ǎ. "
This matter arose because some false brothers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves. ,"Klísusɛntɔ́-nyíjɛtɔ́ ɖé lɛ́ɛ lun byɔ́ mǐ mɛ, bó jló ná gbo ada n'i, có è ka gbo n'i ǎ.

"We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you. ","Mǐ ka lɔn nǔ nú yě nukún xwixwe ɖokpó vɔ́vɔ́ ǎ. Mǐ ka bló nǔ e ba wɛ yě ɖe ɔ́ ǎ, bónú Wɛn Ɖagbe nǔgbó nǔgbó ɔ́ ní nɔ ayǐ nú mi. "
As for those who seemed to be important–whatever they were makes no difference to me,Fon
"On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, just as Peter had been to the Jews. ","É nyɔ́ wa ɔ́, yě mɔ ɖɔ Mawu sɔ́ Wɛn Ɖagbe jlájlá mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ sín azɔ̌ dó así nú mì, lě e é sɔ́ Wɛn Ɖagbe jlájlá mɛ e nyí Jwifu lɛ́ɛ sín azɔ̌ dó así nú Sefási gbɔn é. "
"For God, who was at work in the ministry of Peter as an apostle to the Jews, was also at work in my ministry as an apostle to the Gentiles. ",Đó Mawu e sɔ́ Sefási dó ɖó mɛsɛ́dó nú mɛ e nyí Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ɔ́ wɛ sɔ́ nyɛ lɔmɔ̌ dó ɖó mɛsɛ́dó nú mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ é. 
"James, Peter and John, those reputed to be pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me. They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews. ","Jaki kpódó Sefási kpó, kpódó Jǎan kpán wɛ è nɔ mɔ ɖɔ yě nyí sósyɛ́n nú agun lɛ́ɛ; ée yě mɔ ɖɔ Mawu sɔ́ azɔ̌ énɛ́ dó así nú mì ɔ́, yě ná alɔ nyɛ kpódó Baanabási kpó, bó dó ɖe xlɛ́ ɖɔ azɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́ wa wɛ mǐ ɖe.

"All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do. ",Amɔ̌ yě byɔ́ nǔ ɖokpó mǐ. Yě byɔ́ mǐ ɖɔ mǐ ní nɔ́ flín wamamɔnɔ e ɖo agun émítɔn mɛ ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu lɛ́ɛ. Nǔ e ba ná wa wɛ un ko ɖe ɖ'ayǐ ɔ́ nɛ́. 
"When Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong. ","Lo ɔ́, ée Sefási wá Antyɔ́ci ɔ́, é wa nǔ nyi do, bɔ un gbɛ́ nǔ n'i ɖo mɛ bǐ nukún mɛ. "
"Before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, cóbónú mɛ e Jaki sɛ́ dó lɛ́ɛ ná gosín Jeluzalɛ́mu wá ɔ́, Sefási nɔ ɖu nǔ xá mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ.

"When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter in front of them all, “You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?

"The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. The Scripture does not say “and to seeds,” meaning many people, but “and to your seed,” meaning one person, who is Christ. ","Mawu dó akpá nú Ablaxámu kpódó vǐ tɔn kpán. Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ é kpódó vǐ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpán, bónú è nǎ vɛdó ɖɔ mɛ gěgé xó ɖɔ wɛ é ɖe sín ǎ. Mawuxó ɔ́ ɖɔ hwi kpódó vǐ towe kpán, bó dó ɖo ɖiɖe xlɛ́ wɛ ɖɔ mɛ ɖokpó xó ɖɔ wɛ é ɖe; mɛ énɛ́ ɔ́ wɛ nyí Klísu. "
"What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise. ","Nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ un ɖe ɔ́ ɖíe: Mawu ko sɔ́ akɔjijɛwéma ɖé ɖ'ayǐ, bó dó akpá ɖɔ émí ná bló ɖ'é jí. Sɛ́n e wá tɔ́n xwe afɔwe gban (430) gúdo ɔ́, sixú gbídí nǔ e ɖo akɔjijɛwéma énɛ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ, bɔ akpá e Mawu dó ɔ́ ná nyí nǔ yǎyá ǎ. "
"For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on a promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise. ","Đó ényí sɛ́n wɛ è nɔ nyi cóbó nɔ́ mɔ nǔ ɖagbe e Mawu sɔ́ ɖ'ayǐ nú mɛ lɛ́ɛ yí ɔ́, hǔn nǔ ɖagbe énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ sɔ́ nyí akpá e Mawu dó ɔ́ sín xó ɖé ǎ. Lo ɔ́, akpá e Mawu dó nú Ablaxámu ɔ́ wútu wɛ é ɖe nyɔ̌ná tɔn xlɛ́ Ablaxámu. "
"What, then, was the purpose of the law? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was put into effect through angels by a mediator. ",Étɛ́wú è dǒ sɛ́n ɔ́ lo? È dǒ sɛ́n ɔ́ bónú é ná ɖe zǐnzán e gbɔn vo nú jlǒ Mawu tɔn ɔ́ xlɛ́
"A mediator, however, does not represent just one party; but God is one. ","Đó akpá e Mawu dó ɔ́, é ɖokpónɔ wɛ é kan; é byɔ́ ɖɔ wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn ɖé, abǐ mɛɖé ní ɖe kúnnu ná ǎ. "
"Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law. ","Sɛ́n ɔ́ gbɛ́ akpá e Mawu dó lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ wɛ è ɖe a? Gbeɖé kpɔ́n. Ényí è dǒ sɛ́n ɖé, bɔ sɛ́n énɛ́ hɛn ɔ́, é ná ná gbɛ jɔ gbɛ gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, hǔn mɛ bǐ wɛ sixú nyí hwɛjijɔnɔ ɖo Mawu nukɔn, gbɔn sɛ́n ɔ́ gbla mɛ. "
"But the Scripture declares that the whole world is a prisoner of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe. ","Lo ɔ́, Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ ɖo súsú ɖo hwɛ sín acɛ glɔ́, bónú nǔ e sín akpá Mawu dó ɔ́, é ná ná mɛ e ɖi nǔ lɛ́ɛ, ɖó nǔɖiɖi e yě ɖǒ nú Jezu Klísu ɔ́ wú. "
"Before this faith came, we were held prisoners by the law, locked up until faith should be revealed. ","Cóbónú nǔɖiɖi sín hwenu ná su ɔ́, sɛ́n ɔ́ tó hɛn mǐ gantɔ́ ɖɔhun hwɛ̌, káká jɛ hwenu e Mawu wá ɖe nǔɖiɖi énɛ́ xlɛ́ mǐ dó é. "
So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by faith. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, sɛ́n ɔ́ ɖo mǐ kplɔ́n wɛ káká jɛ hwenu e Klísu wá dó é, bónú Mawu ná zé mǐ dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ gbɔn nǔɖiɖi gbla mɛ. "
"Now that faith has come, we are no longer under the supervision of the law. ","Din e nǔɖiɖi sín hwenu su ɔ́, mǐ sɔ́ ɖo mɛkplɔ́ntɔ́ énɛ́ sín acɛ mɛ ǎ; "
"You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, ","ɖó mi bǐ nyí Mawu ví, ɖo Klísu Jezu mɛ, gbɔn nǔɖiɖi gbla mɛ. "
for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. ,"Nǔgbó ɔ́, è lɛ yɛhwesin nú mi bǐ ɖo Klísu mɛ, bɔ mi sɔ́ Klísu sín jijɔ. "
"There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. ","Hǔn din ɔ́, Jwifu sɔ́ ɖo vo nú mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ é ǎ; kannumɔ sɔ́ ɖo vo nú mɛ e ma nyí kannumɔ ǎ é ǎ; súnnu sɔ́ ɖo vo nú nyɔ̌nu ǎ; ɖó mi mɛ bǐ wɛ nyí ɖokpó ɔ́ ɖo Klísu Jezu mɛ. "
"If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.What I am saying is that as long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate. ","Ényí mi nyí Klísu tɔn hǔn, mi nyí Ablaxámu ví, bɔ nǔ ɖagbe e sín akpá Mawu dó nú Ablaxámu ɔ́, mi ná mɔ yí.Xó e ɖɔ wɛ un ɖe, bó ɖɔ mɔ̌ ɔ́ ɖíe: vǐ e ɖó ná ɖu tɔ́ tɔn sín gǔ, bó má ka ko su ǎ é ɔ́, kannumɔ gbɛ mɛ wɛ é ɖe, có étɔn wɛ ka nyí nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ. "
He is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father. ,"Hwenu e é kpo ɖo yɔkpɔ́vú ɔ́, mɛ wɛ nɔ kpé nukún wǔ tɔn; mɛ wɛ nɔ kpɔ́n nǔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ jí káká jɛ xwe nabí e tɔ́ ɔ́ ɖɔ é ná ɖó, bɔ é ɖésúnɔ ná jɛ nǔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ nu é. "
"So also, when we were children, we were in slavery under the basic principles of the world. ","Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, mǐ lɔmɔ̌ ɔ́, nǔɖoyɛswímɛ gbɛmɛ fí tɔn lɛ́ɛ sín kannumɔ wɛ mǐ ko nyí ɖ'ayǐ, cóbó wá su ɖo Mawu mɛ. "
"But when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under law, ","Lo ɔ́, ée hwe tɔn nu wá su ɔ́, é sɛ́ vǐ tɔn dó gbɔn nyɔ̌nu ɖé jí, bɔ vǐ énɛ́ lɔ nɔ sɛ́n ɔ́ glɔ́, "
"to redeem those under law, that we might receive the full rights of sons. ","bó ná sixú hwlɛ́n mɛ e ɖo sɛ́n ɔ́ glɔ́ lɛ́ɛ gán, bónú mǐ ná sixú húzú vǐ nú Mawu. "
"Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, “Abba, Father.” ","Mawu sɛ́ yɛ vǐ tɔn tɔn dó ayi mǐtɔn mɛ, bó ná dó ɖe xlɛ́ ɖɔ mǐ nyí vǐ émítɔn nǔgbó. Yɛ ɔ́ nɔ sú xó, bó nɔ́ ɖɔ: “Daá ce! Tɔ́ ce vívɛ́ná!” "
"So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a son, God has made you also an heir. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, a sɔ́ nyí kannumɔ ǎ; vǐ wɛ a nyǐ. Ée a ka nyí vǐ ɔ́, Mawu ná ná nǔ ɖagbe e é sɔ́ ɖ'ayǐ nú vǐ tɔn lɛ́ɛ é bǐ we. "
"Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods. ","Đ'ayǐ xóxó ɔ́, mi tunwun Mawu ǎ, bó nyí kannumɔ nú nǔmɛsɛn e ma nyí Mawu jɔ Mawu ǎ lɛ́ɛ. "
But now that you know God–or rather are known by God–how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable principles? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again? ,"Amɔ̌ din e mi tunwun Mawu ɔ́, un ka ná ɖɔ din e mi tunwun Mawu ɔ́ lɔ ǎ; din e Mawu tunwun mi ɔ́, nɛ̌ mi ka sixú lɛ́ lɛ́ kɔ yi nǔmaɖinǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ e má ɖó gǎn ǎ lɛ́ɛ kɔn gbɔn?

You are observing special days and months and seasons and years! ,"Mi nɔ ɖó kɛ́n azǎn ɖé lɛ́ɛ, sun ɖé lɛ́ɛ, hwenu ɖé lɛ́ɛ kpódó xwe ɖé lɛ́ɛ kpó jí, bó nɔ sɔ́ yě dó ɖó nǔ ɖaxó ná. "
"I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you. ",Ado ɖo huhu mì wɛ ɖó mi wú
"I plead with you, brothers, become like me, for I became like you. You have done me no wrong. ","Nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, un ɖo kɛnklɛ́n dó nú mi wɛ; mi húzú, bó cí nyɛ ɖɔhun, lě e nyɛ lɔ húzú, bó cí mi ɖɔhun gbɔn é. Mi wa nǔɖé nyi do nú mì ǎ. "
"As you know, it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you. ",Mi ní flín ɖɔ azɔn jɛ wɛ un ɖe wú wɛ un jlá Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ mi azɔn nukɔn nukɔntɔn ɔ́. 
"Even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself. ","Azɔn e jɛ wɛ un ɖe ɔ́ dó azɔ̌ kɔ nú mi có mi ka dó vɛ̌ nú mì ǎ; mi ka nya mì ǎ; é nyɔ́ wa ɔ́, mi yí mì lě e è nɔ yí wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn gbɔn é. Un ná ɖɔ tawun ɔ́, Klísu Jezu ɖɔhun wɛ mi yí mì. "
"What has happened to all your joy? I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me. ","Xomɛ e nɔ hun mi hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, fítɛ́ é ka gbɔn? Đó un ná ɖe kúnnu nú mi ɖɔ: ényí nukún ɔ́, nǔ wɛ nyí bɔ è nɔ ɖe sín ta wú ɔ́, mi ná ko ɖe bó ná mì. "
Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth? ,"Din ɔ́, kɛntɔ́ mitɔn wɛ un húzú ɖó nǔgbó e un ɖɔ nú mi ɔ́ wú a? "
"Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you from us, so that you may be zealous for them. ","Mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖo ɖagbe mitɔn ba wɛ bó ɖɔ, lo ɔ́, ayixa yětɔn nyɔ́ ǎ. Nǔ e ba wɛ yě ɖe ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ nyɛ kpódó mi kpó ní klán, nú mi ná xwedó yě. "
"It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always and not just when I am with you. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, é nyɔ́ nú è nǐ ba ɖagbe mɛtɔn; è nǐ vɛ kó sixú ba kpódó ayixa ɖagbe kpó, é ní ka nyí hwebǐnu; é ní má nyí hwenu e un ɖo kpɔ́ xá mi ɔ́ kɛ́ɖɛ́ ó. "
"My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you, ","Vǐ ce lɛ́ɛ mi, un lɛ́ ɖo wǔvɛ́ mɔ dó ta mitɔn mɛ wɛ nyɔ̌nu ɖo ajidonu ɖɔhun. Un ná ɖo wǔvɛ́ énɛ́ ɔ́ mɔ wɛ káká jɛ hwenu e mi ná wa nǔ Klísu ɖɔhun dó é. "
"how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you! ","É jló mì nú má ɖo kpɔ́ xá mi din, bó ná sɔ́ gbe vo dó ɖɔ xó nú mi; ɖó ado ɖo huhu mì wɛ tawun ɖó mi wú. "
"Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says? ","Nǔ e un jló ná kanbyɔ́ mi ɔ́, mi mɛ e jló ná nɔ sɛ́n ɔ́ sín acɛ mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mi se nǔ e sɛ́n ɔ́ ɖɔ ɔ́ ǎ cé? "
"For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman. ","È ɖɔ Ablaxámu ɖó vǐ we; é ji ɖokpó ɖo nyɔ̌nu kannumɔ ɔ́ xomɛ, bó ji ɖokpó ɖo mɛ e ma nyí kannumɔ ǎ é xomɛ. "
His son by the slave woman was born in the ordinary way,Fon
"These things may be taken figuratively, for the women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar. ","Nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ e è ɖɔ ɔ́, nǔ jlɛ́ dó nǔ wú wɛ. Nyɔ̌nu we énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, akɔjijɛ we wɛ yě nyí. Nyɔ̌nu e ji vǐ kannumɔ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, Hagáa wɛ, bɔ éyɛ́ sɔ́ akɔ e è jɛ ɖo só Sinayíi tɔn jí ɔ́ sín afɔ ɖó te. "
"Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children. ","Đó Hagáa wɛ nyí só Sinayíi tɔn e ɖo Alabíi é. É wɛ lɛ́ ɖo Jeluzalɛ́mu égbé tɔn ɔ́ nyí wɛ, bɔ é kpódó vǐ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó ɖo kannumɔgbénu. "
"But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother. ",Jeluzalɛ́mu sɛ́xwé tɔn ɔ́ ɖo é ɖésúnɔ sí
"For it is written: “Be glad, O barren woman, who bears no children; break forth and cry aloud, you who have no labor pains; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband.” ","Đó Mawuxó ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Wɛnsinɔ, hwi mɛ e ma ji vǐ kpɔ́n ǎ é, jɛ awǎ; hwi mɛ e ma mɔ wǔvɛ́ ɖo ajidonu kpɔ́n ǎ é, sú xó bó jɛ awǎ; ɖó nyɔ̌nu e asú tɔn gbɛ́ e ná ɖó vǐ hú nyɔ̌nu e ɖo asúxwé é.” "
"Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise. ",Amɔ̌ mi nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi! Vǐ e Mawu dó akpá tɔn bó ji lɛ́ɛ wɛ mi nyí Izáki ɖɔhun. 
At that time the son born in the ordinary way persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now. ,"Đ'ayǐ xóxó ɔ́, mɛ e è ji vǐ bǐ ɖɔhun ɔ́ nɔ dó ya nú mɛ e è ji gbɔn Yɛsinsɛn jí ɔ́; mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́ wɛ é lɛ́ ɖe gbɔn din. "
"But what does the Scripture say? “Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman's son.” ","Lo ɔ́, étɛ́ Mawuxó ɔ́ ɖɔ? É ɖɔ: “Nya nyɔ̌nu mɛsɛntɔ́ ɔ́ kpódó vǐ tɔn kpó; ɖó mɛsɛntɔ́ sín vǐ ná ɖu gǔ xá mɛ e ma nyí mɛsɛntɔ́ ǎ é sín vǐ ǎ.” "
"Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery. ","Hǔn nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi! Mǐ nyí nyɔ̌nu kannumɔ ɔ́ sín vǐ ǎ; nyɔ̌nu e má nyí kannumɔ ǎ é sín vǐ wɛ mǐ nyí.Klísu ɖe mǐ sín sɛ́n ɔ́ kannu, bónú mǐ ná jɛ mǐ ɖésúnɔ sí. Mi bo syɛ́nlǐn, bó má lɛ́ wá húzú kannumɔ ó. "
"Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all. ","Nyɛ Pɔ́lu wɛ tɛ ɖɛ̌ jí, bó ɖo ɖiɖɔ nú mi wɛ ɖɔ ényí mi jó miɖée dó, bónú è gbo ada nú mi hǔn, nǔ e Klísu wa nú mi ɔ́, nǔ yǎyá wɛ. "
Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law. ,"Un lɛ́ ɖo ɖiɖɔ nú mi wɛ ɖɔ: mɛ ɖěbǔ gbo ada lě e Jwifu lɛ́ɛ sín sɛ́n zɔ́n gbɔn ɔ́ hǔn, ní tunwun ɖɔ émí ɖó ná nyi sɛ́n Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn bǐ. "
You who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from Christ,Fon
But by faith we eagerly await through the Spirit the righteousness for which we hope. ,"Mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mǐ ɖo nukún ɖó wɛ ɖɔ Mawu ná sɔ́ mǐ dó húzú hwɛjijɔnɔ. Nǔ énɛ́ ɖó nukún wɛ mǐ ɖe gbɔn Yɛsinsɛn e ɖo azɔ̌ wa wɛ gbɔn nǔɖiɖi mɛ ɔ́ sín hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n jí; "
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love. ,"ɖó ényí mǐ ɖo kpɔ́ xá Klísu Jezu ɔ́, adagbigbo nyí nǔɖé ǎ; adamagbo lɔ ka nyí nǔɖé ǎ. Nǔ e ɖo tají ɔ́ wɛ nyí nǔɖiɖi e nɔ wa nǔ kpódó wǎn yíyí kpó é. "
You were running a good race. Who cut in on you and kept you from obeying the truth? ,Mi ka ɖo nukɔn yi wɛ ganjí ɖ'ayǐ nɛ́! Mɛ̌ ka ɖó mi te bó gbɛ́ ɖɔ mi ní má sɔ́ se tónú nú nǔgbó ɔ́ ó? 
That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you. ,Nǔ énɛ́ e è ɖɔ nú mi káká bɔ mi yí gbe ná ɔ́ gosín Mawu e ɖo mi ylɔ́ wɛ ɔ́ gɔ́n ǎ. 
“A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough.” ,Lě e è ko nɔ ɖɔ gbɔn ɔ́: “Tɔ́n kpɛví ɖé wɛ nɔ fɔ́n linfín e è nya ɔ́ bǐ.” 
"I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is throwing you into confusion will pay the penalty, whoever he may be. ","É ɖo mɔ̌ có un ɖó jiɖiɖe dó mi wú ɖo Aklúnɔ mɛ ɖɔ mi kún ná lin nǔ ɖěvo zɛ ée un lin é wú ó; amɔ̌ mɛ e ɖo hunnyahunnya dó mi mɛ wɛ ɔ́, é ná bo nyí nǔɖébǔnɔ ɔ́, Mawu na dɔn tó n'i. "
"Brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished.

"As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves! ","Un jló ɖɔ mɛ e ɖo hunnyahunnya dó mi mɛ wɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, ní má nyí ada kɛ́ɖɛ́ wɛ yě ná gbo ó; lo ɔ́, yě ní sá yěɖée. "
"You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature; rather, serve one another in love. ","Nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mi ná nɔ mi ɖésúnɔ sí wú wɛ Mawu ylɔ́ mi; amɔ̌ mi ma kpɔ́n ɖɔ émí ko ɖo émí ɖésúnɔ sí, bó wa nǔ e jló mi ɔ́ ó. Lo ɔ́, mi xwedó wǎn yíyí Mawu tɔn, bó húzú mɛsɛntɔ́ nú miɖée. "
The entire law is summed up in a single command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” ,"Đó ényí è sɛ sin xwe nú sɛ́n lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɔ́, nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ yě ɖe ɔ́ ɖíe: “Yǐ wǎn nú nɔzo towe hwi ɖésú ɖɔhun.” "
"If you keep on biting and devouring each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other. ","Mi cɔ́ miɖée, é má nyí mɔ̌ ǎ ɔ́, nú mi zán gbɛ mitɔn gběkanlin lɛ́ɛ ɖɔhun, bó ɖo wǔ gblé miɖée wɛ, bó ɖo ya dó nú miɖée wɛ ɔ́, mi ná sú miɖée kún dó. "
"So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature. ",Un ɖo ɖiɖɔ nú mi wɛ ɖɔ mi ní jó miɖée dó nú Yɛsinsɛn ní xlɛ́ ali mi
"For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature. They are in conflict with each other, so that you do not do what you want.

Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. ,"Mi ma blɛ́ miɖée ó, mɛɖé nɔ wa yɛ nú Mawu ǎ. Nǔ e è dǒ ɔ́ wɛ è nɔ ya. "
"The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. ","Mɛ ɖé wa jlǒ nyanya gbɛtɔ́ tɔn ɔ́, jlǒ nyanya gbɛtɔ́ tɔn ná dɔn kú wá n'i; mɛɖé ka wa jlǒ Yɛsinsɛn tɔn ɔ́, Yɛsinsɛn ná ná ɛ gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ. "
"Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. ","Hǔn awakanmɛ ní má kú mǐ dó nǔ ɖagbe wiwa wú ó. Đó nú awakanmɛ ma kú mǐ ǎ, bónú hwe tɔn nu wá su ɔ́, mǐ ná mɔ ajɔ tɔn yí. "

Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ. ,"Mɛ e ɖɔ ada jɛ́n mi ná gbo dandan lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, nǔ e ba wɛ yě ɖe ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ yě ná ɖe yěɖée xlɛ́ ɖo gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ nukɔn, ɖó yě jlǒ ɖɔ è ní dó ya nú émí ɖó Klísu e kú ɖo aklúzu jí é wú ǎ.

"Not even those who are circumcised obey the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your flesh. ","Yě mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ e gbo ada ɔ́ ɖésú nɔ nyi sɛ́n ɔ́ ǎ. Yě jló ɖɔ mi ní yí gbe bó gbo ada, bó ná dó tɛ afɔ ayǐ ɖɔ émí wɛ gbo ada nú mi. "
"May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.

Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything,Fon
"Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule, even to the Israel of God. ","Fífá kpódó xomɛnyínyɔ́ Mawu tɔn kpó ní nɔ kpɔ́ xá mɛ e nɔ xwedó tito énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖo gbɛzán yětɔn mɛ lɛ́ɛ, bó nɔ kpɔ́ xá mɛɖeɖóvo Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ bǐ. "

made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions–it is by grace you have been saved. ,"bɔ hwenu e mǐ kpo ɖo mɛkúkú ɖɔhun cí wɛ ɖo nukɔn tɔn, ɖó hwɛ mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ wú ɔ́, é bló bɔ mǐ lɛ́ wá gbɛ kpódó Klísu kpó. Fɛ́nú Mawu tɔn mɛ wɛ mi mɔ hwlɛngán ɖe. "

"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith–and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God– ","Đó xomɛnyínyɔ́ Mawu tɔn mɛ wɛ mi mɔ hwlɛngán ɖe, gbɔn nǔ e mi ɖi é gbla mɛ. É nyí mi ɖésúnɔ wɛ hwlɛ́n miɖée gán ǎ; nǔnámɛ Mawu tɔn wɛ. "
"not by works, so that no one can boast. ","É nyí nǔ e mi wa lɛ́ɛ sín ajɔ wɛ ǎ; énɛ́ ɔ́, mɛ ɖěbǔ sixú yí go ná ǎ. "
"For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.

"Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called “uncircumcised” by those who call themselves “the circumcision” (that done in the body by the hands of men)– ","Mi mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu jiji ǎ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, Jwifu lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ ylɔ́ mi ɖɔ atɔtɔnɔ; yě Jwifu lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, è ka nɔ ylɔ́ yě ɖɔ adagbotɔ́, ɖó wuntun e gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ sɔ́ alɔ yětɔn dó ɖó yě wú ɔ́ wútu ɔ́, mi flín nǔ e mi ko nyí ɖ'ayǐ é.

"remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. ","Hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, zɔ wɛ mi ɖe nú Klísu; jǒnɔ wɛ mi nyí nú togun Izlayɛ́li tɔn, bó ɖo togun énɛ́ e Mawu sɔ́ é mɛ ǎ. Akpá e Mawu dó nú togun tɔn, bó dó nu alɛ xá ɛ ɔ́, midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖ'é mɛ ǎ.

But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ. ,"Amɔ̌ din ɔ́, ɖo bǔ e mǐ ɖe xá Klísu Jezu ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, mi mɛ e ɖo zɔ ɖ'ayǐ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mi sɛkpɔ́ Mawu, gbɔn Vǐ tɔn sín hun gbla mɛ. "
"For he himself is our peace, who has made the two one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility, ","Đó Klísu Jezu ɖésúnɔ wɛ hɛn fífá wá nú mǐ; gbɔn kú tɔn gbla mɛ ɔ́, dǒ e klán mɛ e nyí Jwifu é kpódó mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ é kpó ɖó vovo, bó zɔ́n bɔ yě nyí kɛntɔ́ ɔ́, é mu.

"by abolishing in his flesh the law with its commandments and regulations.

He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near. ,"Klísu wá jlá Wɛn Ɖagbe fífá tɔn ɔ́ mi mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ, bó ɖo zɔ nú Mawu ɖ'ayǐ lɛ́ɛ, bó lɛ́ jlá mǐ mɛ e nyí Jwifu, bó kó sɛkpɔ́ ɛ lɛ́ɛ. "
For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit. ,"Đó Klísu jí wɛ mǐ bǐ ná gbɔn, Jwifu kpódó mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ é kpó, bó ná sixú yi Mawu Tɔ́ ɔ́ gɔ́n, kpódó Yɛsinsɛn ɖokpó énɛ́ sín alɔdó kpó. "
"Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God's people and members of God's household, ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wútu ɔ́, mi mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mi sɔ́ nyí jǒnɔ abǐ mɛ e gosín fí ɖěvo bó wá é ǎ; lo ɔ́, mi húzú to ɖokpó ɔ́ mɛ nu xá mɛɖeɖóvo Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ, bó ɖo hɛ̌nnu Mawu tɔn mɛ.

In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. ,"Klísu Jezu wɛ nyí sósyɛ́n nú xɔ ɔ́, bó ná ɛ hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n, nú xɔ ɔ́ ná yi ta, bó ná nyí sinsɛnxɔ mímɛ́ e è sɔ́ ɖó vo nú Aklúnɔ é. "
"And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles– ","Đo bǔ e mi ɖe xá Klísu Jezu ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, mi lɔmɔ̌ nyí blǐki ɖo blǐki e è dǒ mɛ xɔ ɔ́ ná lɛ́ɛ mɛ; bɔ mi kpódó mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpó ná kplé bó ná nyí xɔ e mɛ Yɛ Mawu tɔn nɔ́ nɔ é.Énɛ́ ɔ́ wútu ɔ́, nyɛ Pɔ́lu e ɖo gan sɛn wɛ ɖó Klísu Jezu e sɛn wɛ un ɖe ɔ́ wú, dó mi mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ sín tamɛ ɔ́, "

"In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, ényí ɖɔ mi ɖo xixa wɛ ɔ́, mi hɛn ɔ́, mi ná tunwun lě e un mɔ nukúnnú jɛ nǔbúdo e kan Klísu ɔ́ wú gbɔn é. "
which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets. ,"Đ'ayǐ xóxó ɔ́, Mawu ɖe nǔbúdo énɛ́ ɔ́ xlɛ́ gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ǎ; amɔ̌ din ɔ́, é ɖe xlɛ́ mɛsɛ́dómímɛ́ lɛ́ɛ kpódó gbeyíɖɔ lɛ́ɛ kpán gbɔn Yɛsinsɛn jí. "
"This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.

I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given me through the working of his power. ,"Nǔ e Mawu sɔ́ hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n tɔn, bó ná mì ɖo xomɛnyínyɔ́ tɔn mɛ ɔ́ zɔ́n bɔ azɔ̌ ce nyí Wɛn Ɖagbe jlájlá. "

"I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wútu ɔ́, un ɖo byɔ̌byɔ́ mi wɛ ɖɔ awakanmɛ ní ma kú mi dó wǔvɛ́ e mɔ wɛ un ɖe dó ta mitɔn mɛ é wú ó; ɖagbe mitɔn wú wɛ un ɖo wǔvɛ́ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ mɔ wɛ. "
"For this reason I kneel before the Father, ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ un nɔ jɛ kpo ɖo Mawu Tɔ́ ɔ́, "
from whom his whole family in heaven and on earth derives its name. ,"ée nyí Tɔ́ nú hɛ̌nnu e ɖo sɛ́xwé é bǐ, kpódó ée ɖo ayǐkúngban jí é bǐ kpó ɔ́ nukɔn. "
"I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, ","Un nɔ byɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ, lě e susu tɔn d'agba sɔ ɔ́, ní dó wǔsyɛ́n lanmɛ nú mi kpó hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n kpó gbɔn Yɛsinsɛn jí. "
"so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, ","Un nɔ byɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Klísu ní nɔ ayi mitɔn mɛ gbɔn nǔ e mi ɖi n'i é gbla mɛ. Un nɔ byɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ mi ní dó ɖɔ do, bó lí dǒ ɖo wǎn yíyí mɛ. "

and to know this love that surpasses knowledge–that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God. ,"Nǔgbó wɛ! Mi ní mɔ nukúnnú jɛ wǎn yíyí tɔn wú, énɛ́ ɔ́, nǔ e Mawu nyí ɔ́ ná gɔ́ ayi mitɔn mɛ bǐ dégbédégbé. Có mɛɖé ka nɔ mɔ nukúnnú jɛ wǎn yíyí Mawu tɔn wú yí fó gbeɖé ǎ. "

"to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever!

There is one body and one Spirit– just as you were called to one hope when you were called– ,"Agbaza ɖokpó géé wɛ ɖe, bɔ Yɛsinsɛn ɖokpó géé ɖe lě e nukúnɖíɖó e wú Mawu ylɔ́ mǐ é lɔ nyí ɖokpó géé gbɔn é. "

But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. ,"Có nǔníná vovo wɛ mǐ mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó mɔ yí, bɔ é sɔgbe xá ée Klísu ná é. "
"This is why it says: “When he ascended on high, he led captives in his train and gave gifts to men.” ","Lě e nǔ e è wlǎn dó Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́ ɖɔ gbɔn ɔ́: “Hwenu e é yi jǐ aga ɔ́, é kplá gantɔ́ lɛ́ɛ yi, é ná nǔ gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ.” "
"(What does “he ascended” mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions? ","Étɛ́ ɖɔ wɛ è ka ɖe bó ɖɔ é yi jǐ aga? Ényí è ɖɔ é yi jǐ aga hǔn, é tó jɛ te wá do ɖo ayǐkúngban jí hwɛ̌ nɛ́! "

"It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers, ","É wɛ ná nǔníná vovo gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ.

"Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming.

"Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ. ","Lo ɔ́, mǐ ɖo nǔgbó ɔ́ jlá wɛ kpódó wǎn yíyí kpó ɔ́, mǐ ná ɖo nukɔn yi wɛ ɖo nǔ bǐ mɛ, bó ná ɖo sisɛkpɔ́ Klísu e nyí ta ɔ́ wɛ. "
"From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.

They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts. ,"Ayi yětɔn nɔ́ mɔ nǔ ɖěbǔ ǎ. Gbɛ jɔ gbɛ e Mawu nɔ́ ná mɛ ɔ́, yědɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖó mǐmá ɖěbǔ ɖ'é mɛ ǎ; ɖó yě gǔ, bó tlí tó taala. "
"Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more. ",Nǔ ɖěbǔ sɔ́ nɔ́ nyí winnyá nú yě ǎ
"You, however, did not come to know Christ that way. ","Midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, nǔ e mi kplɔ́n dó Klísu jí ɔ́ nɛ́ ǎ. "
Surely you heard of him and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. ,"Dandan mɛ ɔ́, è ɖɔ Jezu sín xó bɔ mi se. Ée mi ka ɖi nǔ nú Jezu ɔ́, è ko kplɔ́n nǔgbó e ɖo Jezu mɛ ɔ́ mi. "
"You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; ",Hǔn mi ɖó ná ɖe mɛ e mi nyí ɖ'ayǐ xóxó ɔ́ nyi ayǐ.

"Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we are all members of one body. ","Énɛ́ wútu ɔ́, mi jó adingban dó, nú mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó ní ɖɔ nǔgbó nú nɔzo tɔn, ɖó mǐ bǐ wɛ nyí wǔjɔnú agbaza ɖokpó ɔ́ tɔn. "
"“In your anger do not sin”: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, ","Ényí mi sin xomɛ hǔn, mi cɔ́ miɖée bó ma jɛ hwɛ mɛ ó; hwe ma yi xɔ dó xomɛsin mitɔn ó. "
and do not give the devil a foothold. ,Mi ma ná tɛn awǒvi bónú é tɛ́n mi kpɔ́n ó. 
"He who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with his own hands, that he may have something to share with those in need. ","Mɛ e nɔ jɛ ajo ɖ'ayǐ ɔ́, ní jó ajo dó bó wa azɔ̌, bó nyí é ɖésúnɔ kpódó ayijlɔ́jlɔ́ kpó; énɛ́ ɔ́, é ná ɖó nǔ e é ná dó dó alɔ mɛ e nǔɖé hudó lɛ́ɛ é. "
"Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.

"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. ","Mi ma wa nǔ bónú wǔ kú Yɛsinsɛn Mawu tɔn ó; Yɛsinsɛn énɛ́ wɛ nyí wuntun Mawu tɔn e ɖo mi wú é. É wɛ nyí gǎnjɛwú mǐtɔn ɖɔ ayǐ ɖé ná wá hɔ́n, bɔ Mawu ná ɖe mǐ sín nǔ nyanya mɛ bǐ sésé. "
"Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. ","Mi jó akpɔmimɔ dó; mi jó aɖi ɖíɖó dó, bó jó xomɛsin dó; mi jó jlɛɖiɖɔ dó, bó jó mɛnúɖiɖɔ dó. Mi jó adǎkaxixo bǐ dó. "
"Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children ","Mi nyɔ́ xomɛ dó miɖée wú, bó nɔ́ sɔ́ hwɛ kɛ miɖée, lě e Mawu sɔ́ hwɛ kɛ mi ɖo Klísu mɛ gbɔn é.Vǐ vívɛ́ná wɛ mi nyí nú Mawu; énɛ́ ɔ́ wútu ɔ́, mi ɖó ná dó gǎn, bó wa nǔ é ɖɔhun.

"But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God's holy people. ","È ma se agalilɛ xó, nǔblíblíwiwa, abǐ nukúnkɛndídó sín xó vɔ́vɔ́ ɖo tɛ́ntin mitɔn ó; ɖó mɛɖeɖóvo Mawu tɔn wɛ mi nyí. "
"Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving. ","É jɛ xá ɖɔ è nǐ se wunhínhɔ́n xó, xó gbló kpódó xó kwíji kwíji ɖé kpán ɖo nu mitɔn ǎ; lo ɔ́, mi ní nɔ dó kú nú Mawu nú nǔ e é wa nú mi lɛ́ɛ. "
"For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person–such a man is an idolater–has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. ","Mi tunwun ganjí ɖɔ agalɛtɔ́, nǔblíblíwatɔ́ abǐ gwěnɔ ɖé kún xwe axɔ́súɖuɖu Klísu tɔn kpódó Mawu tɔn kpó mɛ gbeɖé ó; ɖó gwě ɔ́, vodúnsinsɛn ɖɔhun wɛ é ɖe. "
"Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient. ","Mɛ ɖé ma sɔ́ xó gbló bó dó blɛ́ mi ná ó, ɖó nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ wútu wɛ Mawu nɔ sin xomɛ dó mɛ e ma nɔ se tónú n'i ǎ lɛ́ɛ. "
Therefore do not be partners with them. ,Hǔn mi ma kpé nǔ ɖěbǔ xá mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ó. 
"For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light ","Đ'ayǐ ɔ́, ablu mɛ wɛ mi ɖe; amɔ̌ din e mi ɖo bǔ xa Aklúnɔ ɔ́, mi ɖo wěziza mɛ; énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, mi nɔ zán gbɛ mitɔn mɛ e nyí wěziza tɔn é ɖɔhun. "

and find out what pleases the Lord. ,Mi nɔ́ tɛ́nkpɔ́n bó nɔ́ tunwun nǔ e nɔ́ nyɔ́ Aklúnɔ nukún mɛ é. 
"Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them. ","Mi ma nɔ wa nǔ nyanya e mɛ e ɖo ablu mɛ lɛ́ɛ nɔ wa é ɖě ó; lo ɔ́, mi ɖe nǔ énɛ́ ɔ́ lɛ́ɛ gba ɖo wěziza nu. "
For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret. ,"Đó nǔ e mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ nɔ wa ɖo nǔglɔ́ ɔ́, è sixú ɖɔ ǎ; winnyánú wɛ. "
"But everything exposed by the light becomes visible, ","Ényí è ɖe nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ gba ɖo wěziza nu ɔ́, è nɔ mɔ nukúnnú jɛ nǔ e yě nyí ɔ́ wú céɖécéɖé. "

"Be very careful, then, how you live–not as unwise but as wise, ","Hǔn mi bo cɔ́ miɖée ganjí dó gbɛ e zán wɛ mi ɖe ɔ́ wú. Mi ma zán gbɛ mitɔn xlonɔ ɖɔhun ó; lo ɔ́, mi zán gbɛ mitɔn nǔnywɛ́tɔ́ ɖɔhun. "
"making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil. ","Mi hwlɛndó hwenu lɛ́ɛ, bó wa nǔ; ɖó hwenu e mǐ ɖe ɔ́ nyɔ́ ǎ. "
"Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wútu ɔ́, mi ma wa nǔ mɛ e ma ɖó ayi xomɛ ǎ é ɖɔhun ó; lo ɔ́, mi tɛ́nkpɔ́n bó tunwun nǔ e Aklúnɔ jló ɖɔ mi ní wa é. "
"Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit. ","Mi ma nu ahan mú ó; ahan nu díngan wɛ nɔ zɔ́n bɔ gbɛ mɛtɔn nɔ gblé; lo ɔ́, Yɛsinsɛn ní gɔ́ ayi mitɔn mɛ. "
"Speak to one another with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord, ","Mi ji han tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ dó dó wǔsyɛ́n lanmɛ nú miɖée, bó lɛ́ ji dó kpa Aklúnɔ kpódó ayixa mitɔn bǐ kpó. "

Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. ,"Mi nɔ hwíhwɛ́ miɖée ɖo miɖée glɔ́, ɖó sísí e mi ɖó nú Klísu ɔ́ wú. "
"Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. ","Nyɔ̌nu lɛ́ɛ mi, mi nɔ hwíhwɛ́ miɖée ɖó asú mitɔn lɛ́ɛ glɔ́, lě e mi nɔ hwíhwɛ́ miɖée ɖó Aklúnɔ glɔ́ gbɔn é. "
"For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. ","Đó asú wɛ nɔ kpa acɛ nú asi tɔn, lě e Klísu kpa acɛ nú agun tɔn gbɔn é. Klísu ɖésú wɛ nyí Mɛhwlɛ́ngántɔ́ nú agun e ɖo agbaza tɔn nyí wɛ é. "
"Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. ",Lě e agun ɔ́ nɔ hwíhwɛ́ éɖée ɖo Klísu glɔ́ gbɔn ɔ́ wɛ nyɔ̌nu lɛ́ɛ lɔ ɖo ná nɔ́ hwíhwɛ́ yěɖée ɖó asú yětɔn lɛ́ɛ glɔ́ gbɔn ɖo nǔ bǐ mɛ. 
"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her ","Súnnu lɛ́ɛ mi, mi yí wǎn nú asi mitɔn lɛ́ɛ, lě e Klísu yí wǎn nú agun ɔ́ gbɔn káká bó sɔ́ éɖée jó dó ta tɔn mɛ é. "
"to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, ","É bló mɔ̌, bó sɔ́ sin kpódó xó tɔn kpó dó lɛ agun ɔ́ wé, bónú é ná sixú nyí agun e jɛ xá bó ná nyí agun Mawu tɔn é. "
"and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. ","Đó é ɖo biba wɛ ɖɔ agun ɔ́ ní wá é ɖésúnɔ nukɔn kpódó susu kpó; é jló ɖɔ agun ɔ́ ní nyɔ́ ɖɛkpɛ, bónú nǔ bǐ ní vɔ ɖ'é wú, bónú è ma mɔ nǔ kwíji ɖěbǔ ɖo wǔ tɔn ó; é ní ma ɖó blɔ̌ ɖěbǔ wǔ ó. "
"In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. ","Hǔn, asú lɛ́ɛ ɖó ná yí wǎn nú asi yětɔn lɛ́ɛ, lě e yě yí wǎn nú agbaza yě ɖésúnɔ tɔn gbɔn é. Mɛ e yí wǎn nú asi tɔn ɔ́, é ɖésúnɔ wɛ é yí wǎn ná. "
"After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church– ","Đó mɛ ɖěbǔ gbɛ́ wǎn nú agbaza é ɖésúnɔ tɔn kpɔ́n gbeɖé ǎ; é nyɔ́ wa ɔ́, be wɛ é nɔ́ lé ná, bó nɔ ná ɛ nǔɖuɖu, lě e Klísu nɔ bló gbɔn nú agun tɔn é; "
for we are members of his body. ,agbaza tɔn sín wǔjɔnú wɛ mǐ nyí. 
"“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.” ","Đó Mawuxó ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ súnnu ná jó tɔ́ tɔn kpódó nɔ tɔn kpó dó, bó ná jɛ kpɔ́ xá asi tɔn, bɔ yě mɛ we lɛ́ɛ bǐ ná húzú ɖokpó géé.” "
This is a profound mystery–but I am talking about Christ and the church. ,"Nǔbúdo titewungbe ɖé wɛ è ɖe xlɛ́ ɖo fí élɔ́, bɔ nyɛ mɔ ɖɔ Klísu kpódó agun ɔ́ kpó xó ɖɔ wɛ é ɖe. "
"However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.

God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus. ,"Ée un ɖɔ un yí wǎn nú mi ɔ́, Mawu tunwun ɖɔ nǔgbó ɖɔ wɛ un ɖe. Wǎn e un yí nú mi ɔ́, Klísu Jezu gɔn wɛ é gosín. "
"And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, ","Đɛ e un nɔ xo nú mi ɔ́ ɖíe: un nɔ byɔ́ Mawu ɖɔ é ní bló bónú wǎn e mi yí nú miɖée ɔ́ ní ɖo jijɛ jí wɛ, bónú mi ní tunwun nǔ ganjí, bó ɖó nukúnnú-mɔjɛnǔmɛ titewungbe. "
"so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ, ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, mi ná sixú tunwun nǔ e nyí nǔ ɖagbe ɔ́ bó sɔ́ bó ná nyí mɛ mímɛ́, bɔ hwenu e Klísu ná lɛ́ kɔ wá ɔ́, è nǎ mɔ nǔɖé ɖɔ dó mi wú ǎ. "

"Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel. ","Nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, un jló nú mi ní tunwun ɖɔ nǔ e jɛ dó jǐ ce ɔ́ lɛ́ zɔ́n bɔ Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ yi nukɔn. "
"As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ. ","Nǔ énɛ́ wɛ zɔ́n, bɔ sɔ́ja hɔnmɛcɔ́tɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpó mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpó tunwun ɖɔ Klísu e un nɔ sɛn ɔ́ wútu wɛ un ɖo gankpá mɛ. "
"Because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and fearlessly. ","Ée nɔví lɛ́ɛ mɔ ɖɔ un ɖo gankpá mɛ ɔ́, yě mɛ gěgé ɖó akɔ́nkpinkpan, bó ɖó jiɖiɖe dó Aklúnɔ wú, bó nɔ syɛ́n ta bó nɔ ɖo Mawuxó jlá d'é jí wɛ ma ɖi xɛsi. "
"It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖo yě mɛ, bó sɔ́ wǔhwan kpó jlɛ kpó sín ayixa dó jlá Klísuxó ɔ́ ná; mɛ ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ ka nɔ jlá Klísuxó ɔ́ kpó ayixa ɖagbe kpó. "
"The latter do so in love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. ","Yě mɛ e nɔ jlá Klísuxó ɔ́ kpódó ayixa ɖagbe kpó lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, yě nɔ wa nǔ kpódó wǎn yíyí kpán, ɖó yě tunwun ɖɔ Mawu sɔ́ mì, nú ma nɔ jɛ ahwan Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ jí. "
"The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains. ","Mɛɖě lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, xó e ɖɔ wɛ yě ɖe lɛ́ɛ gosín ayixa yětɔn mɛ ǎ; lo ɔ́, zalixámɛ sín ayixa wɛ yě sɔ́ dó ɖo Klísuxó ɔ́ jlá ná wɛ; yě ɖo linlin wɛ ɖɔ émí ná dó wǔvɛ́ wǔvɛ́ jí nú mì din e un ɖo gankpá mɛ é. "
"But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice, ","Nú ayixa e dó jlá Klísuxó ɔ́ ná wɛ yě ɖe ɔ́ sɔgbe kpó é ma sɔgbe kpó ɔ́, énɛ́ ɖɔ nǔɖé ǎ; é ná bó nyí alɔkpa ɖěbǔ mɛ ɔ́, è ko jlá Klísuxó ɔ́, bɔ é nyí xomɛhunhun nú mì, bɔ xomɛ tɔn ná ɖo hunhun mì wɛ tɛgbɛ. "
"for I know that through your prayers and the help given by the Spirit of Jesus Christ, what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance. ","Đó un tunwun ɖɔ gbɔn ɖɛ mitɔn lɛ́ɛ kpódó Yɛ Jezu Klísu tɔn sín alɔgɔ́númɛ kpán gbla mɛ ɔ́, nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ sésé ná wá nyí ɖagbe nú mì. "
"I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, un ɖo te, bó ɖo nukún ɖó wɛ syɛ́nsyɛ́n ɖɔ nǔ ɖěbǔ ní ma zɔ́n, bónú winnyá hu mì ó.

"For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. ","Đó nyɛ ɔ́, gbɛ ce ɔ́, Klísu wɛ, bɔ kú nyí le nú mì. "
"If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know! ","Lo ɔ́, nú un nɔ gbɛ ɔ́, un hɛn ɔ́, un ná wa nǔ ɖagbe; hǔn, gbɛ wɛ un ná nɔ a, kú wɛ un ná kú a, un sɔ́ tunwun ée un ná sɔ́ ɖ'é mɛ é ǎ. "
"I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far; ","Un mɔ ɖɔ nǔ we énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɖo dindɔn mì wɛ: un jló ná gosín gbɛ élɔ́ mɛ, bó ná yi nɔ kpɔ́ xá Klísu, énɛ́ ɔ́ ba wɛ un ɖe tawun. "
but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body. ,"Lo ɔ́, nǔ e ɖo tají ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ ma nɔ gbɛ ɖó midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ wútu. "
"Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith, ","Un gán jɛ énɛ́ wú, bó tunwun ɖɔ un ná nɔ ayǐ, bó nɔ kpɔ́ xá mi bǐ, bó ná dó alɔ mi bɔ mi ná ɖó nukɔn yiyi, bó ná ɖó xomɛhunhun ɖo nǔɖiɖi e mi ɖó nú Klísu ɔ́ mɛ. "
so that through my being with you again your joy in Christ Jesus will overflow on account of me. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, hwenu e un ná lɛ́ wá mi gɔ́n ɔ́, mi na ɖeji, bó gó ɖo Klísu Jezu mɛ ɖó nyɛ wú. "
"Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, contending as one man for the faith of the gospel ","Nǔ e mi ná wa kpowun ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ mi ní zán gbɛ mitɔn lě e Wɛn Ɖagbe Klísu tɔn ɔ́ zɔ́n gbɔn é. Énɛ́ wú ɔ́, nú un wá mi gɔ́n oo, abǐ un gɔn mi gɔ́n oo, má se ɖɔ mi syɛ́nlǐn, bó ɖó linlin ɖokpó ɔ́, lobo zé ayixa ɖokpó ɔ́ dó ɖo ahwan fun ɖó kpɔ́ wɛ, nú nǔɖiɖi e Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ nɔ na mɛ é. "
"without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved–and that by God. ","Mi ma jó miɖée dó nú kɛntɔ́ mitɔn lɛ́ɛ ní dó xɛsi nú mi ɖo nǔ ɖěbǔ mɛ ó; énɛ́ ɔ́ ná nyí xlɛ́ nú yě ɖɔ bǔbú wɛ yě ɖe, bó ka ná nyí xlɛ̌ nú midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ hwlɛngán li jí wɛ mi ɖe; Mawu sín azɔ̌ wɛ nyí énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ. "
"For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him, ","Đó Mawu wa ɖagbe nú mi, bɔ mi ná sɛn Klísu; é nyí mi ná ɖi nǔ n'i kpowun wɛ ǎ, lo ɔ́, mi ná ji ya lɔmɔ̌ ɖó ta tɔn mɛ. "
"since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.If you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, ","Din ɔ́, nyɛ kpó mi kpó bǐ wɛ ɖo ahwan fun ɖó kpɔ́ wɛ, bɔ ahwan e fun wɛ mi ɖe ɔ́, mi mɔ bɔ un fun ɖ'ayǐ, bó ka lɛ́ kpo ɖo funfun wɛ din, lě e mi se gbɔn é.Nǔɖiɖi e mi ɖó nú Klísu ɔ́ nɔ́ ná hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n mi d'é jí a?

"then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose. ","Hǔn un ɖo byɔ̌byɔ́ mi wɛ ɖɔ mi ní ɖó gbe kpɔ́, bó ɖó wǎn yíyí ɖokpó ɔ́, bó ɖó ayixa ɖokpó ɔ́ kpódó linlin ɖokpó ɔ́ kpán, bó ná dó dó xomɛhunhun nú mì yi kpé. "
"Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. ","Mi ma sɔ́ ce jɛ́n ná nyɔ́ sín ayixa, abǐ mɛɖée sɔ́ su dó wǔvɔ́ sín ayixa dó wa nǔ ɖěbǔ ná ó; lo ɔ́, mi nɔ sɔ́ miɖée hwe ɖo mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ nukɔn, bónú mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó ní nɔ mɔ ɖɔ mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ hú gǎn émí. "
"Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others. ","Mɛɖěbǔ ma nɔ ba ɖagbe é ɖésúnɔ tɔn ó; lo ɔ́, mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó ní nɔ ba ɖagbe mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ tɔn. "
Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus: ,Mi ɖó ninɔmɛ e Klísu Jezu ɖó é. 
"Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, ",Klísu ko ɖó ninɔmɛ Mawu tɔn sín do
"but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. ","É nyɔ́ wa ɔ́, é ɖésúnɔ ɔ́ gbɛ́ nǔ e é ɖó ɔ́ bǐ, bó zé ninɔmɛ mɛsɛntɔ́ tɔn. É húzú gbɛtɔ́, bó wá ɖi gbɛtɔ́ yǎyá kpowun ɖé ɖɔhun. "
"And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death– even death on a cross! ","É yí gbe bó sɔ́ éɖée hwe, bó se tónú nú Mawu káká yi kú; aklúzu jí wɛ é kú ɖe lɔ. "
"Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ Mawu sɔ́ ɛ su, bó sɔ́ ɛ ɖó tɛn e nyí ɖaxó bǐ ɔ́ mɛ, lobo ná ɛ nyǐkɔ e hú gǎn nyǐkɔ ɖě lɛ́ɛ bǐ é, "
"that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, ","bónú è ylɔ̌ Jezu sín nyǐkɔ hweɖěbǔnu ɔ́, mɛ e ɖo jǐxwé lɛ́ɛ bǐ, kpó mɛ e ɖo ayǐkúngban jí lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpó, kpódó mɛ e ɖo ayǐkúngban glɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpán ná jɛ kpo kpó sísí kpó, "
"and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. ",bónú mɛ bǐ ná jlá ɖɔ Jezu Klísu wɛ nyí Aklúnɔ
"Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed–not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence–continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, mɛvívɛ́ná ce lɛ́ɛ mi, hwenu e un ɖo kpɔ́ xá mi ɔ́, mi nɔ se tónú nú mì tɛgbɛ; din e un ma ka sɔ́ ɖo kpɔ́ xá mi ǎ ɔ́, é lɛ́ ɖo tají ɖɔ mi ní lɛ́ se tónú nú mì. Mi wa azɔ̌ kpó xɛsi kpó, kpódó sísɔ́sísɔ́ kpán nú hwlɛngán mitɔn ná nyí hwlɛngán kpíkpé. "
for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose. ,"Đó Mawu ɖo azɔ̌ wa ɖo mi wú wɛ tɛgbɛ, bónú mi ná sixú nɔ ɖó jló, bó ná nɔ wa nǔ e sɔgbe xá tito é ɖésúnɔ tɔn é. "
"Do everything without complaining or arguing, ","Mi wa nǔ bǐ; mi ma húnhún nǔ ɖɔ ɖo nǔ e wa wɛ mi ɖe lɛ́ɛ ɖě kɔn ó, mi ma ka dɔn nǔ ɖo ɖě kɔn ó; "
"so that you may become blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and depraved generation, in which you shine like stars in the universe ","énɛ́ ɔ́, mi ná nyí xomɛvɔ́nɔ, bó ná nyí mɛ mímɛ́, lobo ná nyí Mawu ví maɖóblɔ̌ɖowǔ ɖo gbɛtɔ́ nyanya, ayigɛ́dɛ́gɛ́dɛ́nɔ gbɛmɛ fí tɔn lɛ́ɛ tɛ́ntin.

as you hold out the word of life–in order that I may boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor for nothing. ,"bó ná nɔ ɖɔ xó e nɔ ná gbɛ mɛ ɔ́ nú yě.

"But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you. ","É ná bó byɔ́ ɖɔ è nǎ hu mì dó sá vɔ̌ ná gɔ́ nú vɔ̌ e sá nú Mawu wɛ mi ɖe gbɔn nǔɖiɖi mitɔn gbla mɛ ɔ́, awǎjijɛ wɛ é nyí nú mì, bɔ mi mɛ bǐ ná jɛ awǎ xá mì. "
So you too should be glad and rejoice with me. ,"Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, mi lɔmɔ̌ mi ɖó ná jɛ awǎ, bɔ un ná jɛ awǎ xá mi. "
"I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I receive news about you. ","Đo Aklúnɔ Jezu sín nyǐkɔ mɛ ɔ́, un ɖo linlin wɛ ɖɔ zaanɖé din ɔ́, un ná sɛ́ Timɔtée dó mi, bónú é lɛ́ kɔ wá ɔ́, xó mitɔn e é ná wá ɖɔ nú mì lɛ́ɛ ná ná akɔ́nkpinkpan nyɛ ɖésú. "
"I have no one else like him, who takes a genuine interest in your welfare. ","Nǔ e ɖo hǔn mɛ nú mì lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, é ɖokpónɔ géé wɛ nɔ ɖɔ xá mì, bɔ lě e nǔ ná nɔ bó ná nyɔ́ nú mi ɔ́ ɖo ayixa mɛ n'i titewungbe. "
"For everyone looks out for his own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. ","Mɛɖě lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɔ́, nǔ yě ɖésúnɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ jɛ́n nɔ myá nukún nú yě; nǔ e nyí Jezu Klísu tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖě nɔ́ myá nukún nú yě ǎ. "
"But you know that Timothy has proved himself, because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel. ","Mi ɖésúnɔ ɔ́, mi tunwun ninɔmɛ Timɔtée tɔn; lě e nyɛ kpó e kpó wa azɔ̌ vǐ kpó tɔ́ kpó ɖɔhun gbɔn, bó jlá Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́, mi tunwun. "

And I am confident in the Lord that I myself will come soon. ,"Un ka ɖeji dó Aklúnɔ wú ɖɔ, ɖo malín málín mɛ din ɔ́, nyɛ ɖésúnɔ ná wá mɔ mi. "
"But I think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger, whom you sent to take care of my needs. ","Nɔví mǐtɔn Epafloditi e jí mi sɛ́ nǔ e hudó mì lɛ́ɛ gbɔn ɔ́, nyɛ kpó é kpó wa azɔ̌ ɖó kpɔ́, bó fun ahwan ɖó kpɔ́; din ɔ́, un mɔ ɖɔ é nyɔ́ nú ma lɛ́ kɔ n'i sɛ́ dó mi. "
For he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill. ,"É ɖó jlǒ ɖaxó ɖɔ émí ní mɔ mi bǐ, bɔ é ɖo hǔn mɛ n'i ɖésú, ɖó mi se ɖɔ é jɛ azɔn. "
"Indeed he was ill, and almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow. ","É jɛ azɔn nǔgbó, bó ɖibla kú; amɔ̌, Mawu kú nǔbláwǔ n'i, é ka nyí é ɖokpó wɛ Mawu kú nǔbláwǔ ná ǎ; é kú nǔbláwǔ nú nyɛ lɔmɔ̌, bónú aluwɛ mɛ e un ko ɖe ɔ́ ní ma lɛ́ jɛ jí ó. "
"Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety. ","É ɖo ayi mɛ nú mì ɖɔ ma yá wǔ sɛ́ ɛ dó mi, bónú mi mɔ ɛ ɔ́, xomɛ ná lɛ́ hun mi, bɔ nyɛ ɖésúnɔ ɔ́ ka sɔ́ ná nɔ aluwɛ mɛ ǎ. "
"Welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor men like him, ","Nú é wá hǔn, mi bo yí i kpódó xomɛhunhun ɖaxó kpán, nɔví ɖo Aklúnɔ mɛ ɖɔhun. Mi ɖó ná ɖó sísí nú gbɛtɔ́ étɔn ɖɔhun lɛ́ɛ. "
"because he almost died for the work of Christ, risking his life to make up for the help you could not give me.Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you. ","Đó é ɖibla kú ɖó Klísu sín azɔ̌ tamɛ.

"Watch out for those dogs, those men who do evil, those mutilators of the flesh. ",Mi cɔ́ miɖée dó nǔnyanyawatɔ́ nɛ́ lɛ́ɛ wú
"For it is we who are the circumcision, we who worship by the Spirit of God, who glory in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh– ","Mǐ mɛ e nɔ sɛn Mawu ɖo Yɛ Mawu tɔn mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mǐ wɛ gbo ada titewungbe ɔ́; mǐ wɛ nɔ xɔ susu ɖo Klísu Jezu mɛ; mǐ wɛ ma nɔ gán jɛ walɔ gbɛtɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ wú ǎ. "
"though I myself have reasons for such confidence. If anyone else thinks he has reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more: ","Có nyɛ lɔmɔ̌ hɛn ɔ́, un ná gán jɛ walɔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ wú.

"circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee; ","Đó Izlayɛ́li ví jiji wɛ nú mì, bɔ un jɔ ɖo Bɛnjamɛ́ɛ sín hɛ̌nnu mɛ.

But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. ,"Đ'ayǐ ɔ́, un nɔ mɔ ɖɔ nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ nyí le nú mì; amɔ̌ din ɔ́, un nɔ mɔ nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ dó mɔ nǔ lá mɛ ná ɖó Klísu wútu. "
"What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ ","É nyí nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ kɛ́ɖɛ́ wɛ un mɔ dó mɔ nǔ lá mɛ ná ǎ; lo ɔ́, nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ un mɔ dó mɔ nǔ lá mɛ ná, ɖó vǐví ɖaxó e un mɔ hwenu e un wá tunwun ɖɔ Klísu Jezu ɔ́, Aklúnɔ ce wɛ é nyí ɔ́ wútu; éyɛ́ wútu wɛ un gbɛ́ nǔ bǐ, bó nɔ́ mɔ nǔ bǐ dó mɔ babá, bó ná sixú nyí étɔn, "
"and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ–the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith. ","bó ná nɔ bǔ xá ɛ titewungbe; un sɔ́ nɔ́ lin ɖɔ tónú e un nɔ se nú sɛ́n ɔ́ wútu wɛ un nyí hwɛjijɔnɔ ɖo Mawu nukɔn ǎ; nǔɖiɖi e un ɖó nú Klísu ɔ́ wútu wɛ un nyí hwɛjijɔnɔ ɖo Mawu nukɔn.

"I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, ","Nǔ e ba wɛ un ɖe kpowun ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ ma tunwun mɛ e Klísu nyí é, bó tunwun hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n e fínfɔ́n sín kú tɔn ɖó é; un jló ɖɔ ma ji ya é ɖɔhun, bó kú kú e é kú é, "
"and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection from the dead. ",bó ná ɖo nukún ɖó wɛ ɖɔ Mawu ná fɔ́n nyɛ lɔmɔ̌ sín kú. 
"Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. ","Un ko mɔ nǔ e ba wɛ un ɖe ɔ́, abǐ un ko sɔgbe bɔ nǔ vɔ ɖ'é wú ɖɔ wɛ un ɖe ǎ; lo ɔ́, un kpo ɖo gǎn dó wɛ ɖo nǔ e ba wɛ un ɖe ɔ́ gúdo, bónú é ná jɛ alɔ ce mɛ; ɖó un ko ɖo Klísu Jezu sín alɔ mɛ. "
"Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, ","Hǔn, nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, un lin ɖɔ un ko mɔ nǔ e ba wɛ un ɖe ɔ́ yí ǎ; lo ɔ́, nǔ ɖokpó e wa wɛ un ɖe ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ un ɖo nǔ e ɖo gǔdo ce lɛ́ɛ wɔn wɛ, bó ɖo gǎn dó wɛ, lobo ná yi nǔ e ɖo nukɔn ce ɔ́ kɔn. "
I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, un ɖo wezun jí xwe nǔ e ba wɛ un ɖe ɔ́ kɔn, bó ná dó mɔ ajɔ e Mawu ylɔ́ mǐ sín sɛ́xwé ɖɔ mǐ ná yí gbɔn Klísu Jezu jí ɔ́ yí. "
"All of us who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you. ","Mǐ mɛ e ko lí dǒ ɖo nǔɖiɖi mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɔ́, mǐ ní lin nǔ ɖokpó ɔ́. É ka ɖo mɔ̌ có, ényí mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖo mi mɛ, bó ɖó linlin vo ɔ́, Mawu ná ná wěziza mi d'é wú. "
Only let us live up to what we have already attained. ,"Nǔ ɖěbǔ ná bó ɖo jijɛ wɛ hǔn, mi nú mǐ nǎ wlí ali e jí mǐ kó ɖe káká jɛ din ɔ́ ɖidó fí e mǐ xwe é. "
"Join with others in following my example, brothers, and take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you. ","Nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, mi bǐ ní bló nyɛ ɖɔhun. Mǐ ko ná xlɛ́ tɔn: hǔn mi sɔ́ nukún mitɔn ɖó yě mɛ e gbɛzínzán yětɔn nɔ sɔgbe xá xlɛ́ mǐtɔn énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ é jí. "
"For, as I have often told you before and now say again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. ","Un ko nɔ ɖɔ nú mi hwɛhwɛ, bó ka lɛ́ ɖo vǐvɔ́ ɖɔ nú mi wɛ din kpó avǐ kpó ɖɔ mɛ gěgé tíin, bɔ gbɛzínzán yětɔn nɔ ɖe xlɛ́ ɖɔ yě nyí kɛntɔ́ Klísu e kú ɖo aklúzu jí ɔ́ tɔn. "
"Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is on earthly things. ","Fí e yě ná yi dɔn ɖe ɔ́ wɛ yě kán wezun xwe; ɖó nǔ ɖokpó e yě nɔ sɛn ɔ́ wɛ nyí adɔgo yětɔn; yě nɔ xɔ susu ɖo nǔ e ɖó ná hu winnyá nú yě ɔ́ mɛ, bɔ gbɛ mɛ fí sín nǔ lɛ́ɛ kɛ́ɖɛ́ jí jɛ́n ayixa yětɔn nɔ ɖe.

"But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, ","Mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, sɛ́xwé tɔn wɛ mǐ nyí, bó ɖo te kpɔ́n Mɛhwlɛ́ngántɔ́ mǐtɔn e nyí Aklúnɔ Jezu Klísu ɔ́ vɛ́návɛ́ná. "
"who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.Therefore, my brothers, you whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, that is how you should stand firm in the Lord, dear friends! ","Ényí é ko wá ɔ́, é ná zán hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n tɔn e é nɔ dó sɔ́ nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ dó acɛ tɔn mɛ ná ɔ́, dó húzú agbaza mǐtɔn ayǐkúngban jí fí tɔn maɖógǎnɖé ɔ́ ná, bɔ agbaza mǐtɔn ná xɔ susu étɔn ɔ́ ɖɔhun.Énɛ́ ɔ́, nɔví ce vívɛ́ná lɛ́ɛ mi, é jló mì ɖésú ɖɔ ma lɛ́ mɔ mi; mi nɔ wa nǔ, bɔ xomɛ nɔ hun mì, bɔ un nɔ xɔ susu ɖ'é mɛ tawun; mɛvívɛ́ná ce lɛ́ɛ mi, lě e mi ɖó ná syɛ́nlǐn ɖo gbɛzínzán mitɔn mɛ, ɖo Aklúnɔ mɛ gbɔn ɔ́ nɛ́.

I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to agree with each other in the Lord. ,"Evodíi kpódó Sɛntíci kpó e, un ɖo vo sa nú mi wɛ, ɖɔ mi ní kɛnklɛ́n bo ɖó gbe kpɔ́ nɔví ɖo Aklúnɔ mɛ ɖɔhun. "
"Yes, and I ask you, loyal yokefellow, help these women who have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life. ","Hwi mɛ e nyí azɔ̌gbɛ́ ce gbejínɔtɔ́ ɔ́, un ɖo byɔ̌byɔ́ hwi lɔmɔ̌ wɛ ɖɔ hwi ní dó alɔ nyɔ̌nu énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ; nǔgbó ɔ́, nyɛ kpódó yě kpó fun ahwan ɖó kpɔ́, bónú Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ ná gba kpé: mǐ kpó Klemáa kpó, kpódó azɔ̌gbɛ́ ce lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpán wɛ fun ahwan énɛ́ ɔ́; mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ sín nyǐkɔ wɛ Mawu wlán dó gbɛwéma ɔ́ mɛ. "
Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! ,"Mi jɛ awǎ hwebǐnu, ɖó mi ɖo bǔ ɖo Aklúnɔ mɛ; un ɖo vǐvɔ́ ɖɔ wɛ ɖɔ mi ní jɛ awǎ. "
Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. ,Mi fá xomɛ dó mɛ bǐ wú. Aklúnɔ ná wá zaanɖé din. 
"Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. ","Ado ma hu mi dó nǔ ɖěbǔ wú ó; lo ɔ́, mi ɖo ninɔmɛ ɖěbǔ mɛ hǔn, mi ní nɔ sɔ́ kúdónúmɛ sín ayixa dó xo ɖɛ, bó byɔ́ nǔ e hudó mi lɛ́ɛ Mawu. "
"And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, fífá Mawu tɔn e hú gǎn nukúnnú-mɔjɛnǔmɛ gbɛtɔ́ tɔn bǐ ɔ́ ná bló ayixa mitɔn kpódó linlin mitɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó ɖó, bɔ mi ná sixú nɔ bǔ ɖo Klísu Jezu mɛ. "
"Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable–if anything is excellent or praiseworthy–think about such things. ","Nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, bó ná dó fó xó ce ɔ́, un ɖo byɔ̌byɔ́ mi wɛ ɖɔ ayixa mitɔn ní nɔ nǔ e nyɔ́, bɔ susu jɛ xá lɛ́ɛ jí: nǔ e nyí nǔgbó ɔ́ bǐ, nǔ e è nǎ ɖó sísí ná é, nǔ e sɔgbe é, nǔ e mɛ́ é, nǔ e nɔ nyɔ́ mɛ nukún mɛ é kpódó nǔ e wlí yɛ̌yi ɔ́ kpán; ayixa mitɔn ní nɔ nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ jí. "
"Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me–put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you. ","Nǔ e un kplɔ́n mi lɛ́ɛ, nǔ e mi yí ɖo gɔ̌n ce lɛ́ɛ, nǔ e mi se ɖo nu ce lɛ́ɛ, kpódó nǔ e un wa, bɔ mi mɔ lɛ́ɛ kpó ɔ́, mi zé dó wa azɔ̌ ná; énɛ́ ɔ́, Mawu e nɔ ná fífá mǐ ɔ́ ná nɔ kpɔ́ xá mi. "
"I rejoice greatly in the Lord that at last you have renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you have been concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it. ","Đo bǔ e un ɖe xá Aklúnɔ ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, un mɔ awǎjijɛ ɖaxó, ɖó mi lɛ́ jɛ ɖiɖe xlɛ́ jí lo, ɖɔ nyɛ ɖo ayi mɛ nú émí.

"I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. ","É ka nyí nǔɖé wɛ hudó mì wɛ zɔ́n bɔ un ɖo mɔ̌ ɖɔ wɛ ǎ, ɖó un ko kplɔ́n nyɛɖée, bɔ nǔ e un ɖó ɔ́ nɔ kpé mì. "
"I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. ","Un nyɔ́ wamamɔnɔgbɛ zán, bó nyɔ́ dɔkunnɔgbɛ zán.

I can do everything through him who gives me strength. ,"Mɛ e nɔ ná hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n mì ɔ́ wɛ nɔ zɔ́n, bɔ un nɔ sixú kpé nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ wú. "
Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles. ,"É ka ɖo mɔ̌ có, alɔ e mi dó mì ɖo nǔ e ɖo gbigbo mì wɛ lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɔ́, nǔ ɖagbe wɛ mi wa. "
"Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only; ","Filípunu lɛ́ɛ mi, mi ɖésúnɔ ɔ́, mi tunwun ganjí ɖɔ ée un gosín Masedwani, hwenu e è jɛ Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ jlá jí ɔ́, midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ kɛ́ɖɛ́ wɛ nyí agun e dó alɔ mì é; midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖokpónɔ wɛ mɔ do nú akwɛ́ e un nɔ mɔ ɔ́ kpó ée un nɔ zán é kpó.

"for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid again and again when I was in need. ","Hwenu e un ɖo Tɛsaloniki ɖ'ayǐ ɔ́, nǔ e nɔ hudó mì lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, azɔn mɔ̌kpán wɛ mi sɛ́ dó mì. "
"Not that I am looking for a gift, but I am looking for what may be credited to your account. ","É nyí nǔ e mi ná ná mì lɛ́ɛ ba wɛ un ɖe kpowun ǎ; lo ɔ́, un jló ɖɔ nǔ ɖagbe e wa wɛ mi ɖe lɛ́ɛ ní jɛ jí nú ɖagbe mitɔn. "
"I have received full payment and even more; I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God. ","Un mɔ nǔ e mi sɛ́ dó mì lɛ́ɛ bǐ, bɔ é kpé mì kpo; din e Epafloditi hɛn nǔ e mi ná mì lɛ́ɛ wá nú mì ɔ́, nǔ e ɖo tají nú mì lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɖo así ce; nǔ e mi ná mì lɛ́ɛ cí vɔ̌sánú wǎnɖagbenɔ ɖɔhun, bó cí vɔ̌sísá e nɔ nyɔ́ Mawu nukún mɛ, bɔ é nɔ yí gbe ná ɔ́ ɖɔhun.

And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus. ,"Mawu ce ɔ́, dɔkun ɖo así tɔn bó túnflá; é ná ná nǔ e hudó mi lɛ́ɛ bǐ mi ɖo susu tɔn mɛ, gbɔn Klísu Jezu jí. "

"And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy.

"For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, ",Đó é nyɔ́ Mawu nukún mɛ ɖɔ émí ní nɔ Vǐ émítɔn mɛ bǐ dégbédégbé. 
"and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.

Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior. ,"Đ'ayǐ ɔ́, mi lɔmɔ̌ mi lín dó Mawu; kɛntɔ́ tɔn wɛ mi nyí ɖ'ayǐ, ɖó nǔ nyanya e mi nɔ lin, bó nɔ wa lɛ́ɛ bǐ wú. "
"But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation– ","Amɔ̌ din ɔ́, Vǐ tɔn húzú gbɛtɔ́ lobo kú, bɔ é bló bɔ mǐ dó hwɛ gbɔ xá ɛ gbɔn Vǐ tɔn sín kú gbla mɛ, bónú mi ná sixú nyí mɛɖeɖóvo, bó nyí mɛ mímɛ́, mɛ ma ɖó blɔ̌ ɖo wǔ ɖo nukɔn tɔn.

"if you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant. ","É ɖo mɔ̌ có, mi ka ɖó ná nɔ nǔɖiɖi mɛ, bó ná syɛ́nlǐn ɖo dodó syɛ́nsyɛ́n jí; mi ma jó miɖée dó bónú mɛɖé ní sɛ tɛn nú mi sín nǔ e ɖó nukún wɛ mi ɖe sín hwenu e mi ko se Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ dó ɔ́ kɔn ó.

"Now I rejoice in what was suffered for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ's afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church. ","Din ɔ́, wǔvɛ́ e mɔ wɛ un ɖe ɖó mi wú ɔ́ nɔ ná xomɛhunhun mì.

I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness– ,"Un húzú mɛsɛntɔ́ nú agun Klísu tɔn, bɔ é sɔgbe xá azɔ̌ e Mawu sɔ́ dó así nú mì, ɖɔ ma wa nú mi é: azɔ̌ e é sɔ́ dó así nú mì ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ ma jlá xó tɔn fó. "

"To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. ","Đó Mawu jló ná ɖe tito tɔn e ɖo wi mɛ ɔ́ xlɛ́ yě; tito énɛ́ e nyí é ɖésúnɔ tɔn, bɔ dɔkun ɖ'é mɛ sɔ mɔ̌, bó nyí tito ɖagbe ɖagbe ɔ́, é sɔ́ ɖ'ayǐ nú nyɔ̌ná togun lɛ́ɛ bǐ tɔn.

"We proclaim him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ.

"To this end I labor, struggling with all his energy, which so powerfully works in me.I want you to know how much I am struggling for you and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not met me personally. ","Bónú un ná dó sixú wa azɔ̌ énɛ́ ɔ́, hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n ɖaxó e Klísu nɔ ná mɛ ɔ́ wɛ é ná mì, bɔ un dó ɖo azɔ̌ wa ná wɛ, bó dó ɖo gǎn dó wɛ; hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n énɛ́ ɔ́ wɛ ɖo azɔ̌ wa wɛ ɖo gbɛzán ce mɛ.Tagba e jɛ dó ta mitɔn mɛ wɛ un ɖe, bó ɖo jijɛ dó Lawodiséenu lɛ́ɛ kpódó mɛ e ma tunwun mì titewungbe lě ǎ lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpán tamɛ wɛ ɔ́, un jló ɖɔ mi ní tunwun lě e é syɛ́n gbɔn é.

"My purpose is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ, ","Un ɖo ahwan fun wɛ, bónú yě ní ɖó akɔ́nkpinkpan nǔjɔnǔ tɔn, bónú yě ní nyí ɖokpó ɖo wǎn yíyí mɛ, bónú gǎnjɛwú e nǔnywɛ́ titewungbe ɔ́ nɔ ná mɛ ɔ́ ní gɔ́ ayi mɛ nú yě ganjí; énɛ́ ɔ́, yě ná sixú tunwun nǔbúdo Mawu tɔn; Klísu ɖésú wɛ nyí nǔbúdo énɛ́.

I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine-sounding arguments. ,"Un ɖɔ xó nú mi gbɔn mɔ̌, bónú mɛɖé ma ɖɔ xó víví dó blɛ́ mi ná ó. "
"For though I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit and delight to see how orderly you are and how firm your faith in Christ is. ","Ényí un tlɛ lín dó mi ɖo agbaza mɛ ɔ́, un ɖo kpɔ́ xá mi ɖo ayi mɛ, bɔ lě e un mɔ bɔ mi nɔ wa nǔ dó tito jí ganjí gbɔn, bó lí dǒ ɖo nǔɖiɖi e mi ɖó nú Klísu ɔ́ mɛ gbɔn ɔ́, víví nú mì. "
"So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live in him, ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, ée mi yí Klísu Jezu dó yí Aklúnɔ mitɔn ná ɔ́, mi bo nɔ bǔ xá ɛ ɖo gbɛzán mitɔn mɛ. "

"See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ. ","Mi cɔ́ miɖée, bónú mɛɖé ma zé mɛblɛ́blɛ́xó, xómaɖixó, nǔnywɛ́ gbɛtɔ́ tɔn dó dó gɛdɛ mi ó; nǔnywɛ́ énɛ́ ɔ́, nǔkplɔ́nmɛ gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ tɔn jí wɛ é jínjɔ́n, bó jínjɔ́n nǔɖoyɛswímɛ e ɖo gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ sín hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n jí; é jínjɔ́n Klísu jí ǎ.

"For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form, ","ɖó nǔ e Mawu nyí ɔ́ bǐ ko yí agbaza ɖo Klísu mɛ, bónú Mawu ná nɔ Klísu mɛ bǐ sésé, "
"and you have been given fullness in Christ, who is the head over every power and authority. ","bɔ mi yí nǔ bǐ sésé ɖo bǔ e mi ɖe xá Klísu ɔ́ mɛ. Éyɛ́ wɛ ɖo ta nú gǎn lɛ́ɛ bǐ, kpódó acɛkpikpa lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpán. "
"In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of the sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by the hands of men but with the circumcision done by Christ, ","È ko gbo ada nú mi ɖo bǔ e mi ɖe xá Klísu é mɛ; é ka nyí ada e gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ nɔ gbo nú mɛ ɔ́ wɛ ǎ; lo ɔ́, ada e Klísu nɔ gbo nú mɛ ɔ́ wɛ, bɔ é ɖe mi sín agbaza mitɔn hwɛhutɔ́ ɔ́ sín acɛ mɛ.

"having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, ée è lɛ yɛhwesin nú mi ɔ́, è ɖi mi kpódó Klísu kpán, bó lɛ́ fɔ́n mi kpó e kpó sín kú, ɖó mi ɖi nǔ nú Mawu e fɔ́n ɛ sín kú é sín hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n. "
"When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, ","Đ'ayǐ ɔ́, mɛkúkú wɛ mi nyí, ɖó hwɛ mitɔn lɛ́ɛ wútu; ɖó mi nyí Jwifu ǎ; mi tunwun Mawusɛ́n ɔ́ ǎ; amɔ̌ din ɔ́, Mawu bló, bɔ mi lɛ́ wá gbɛ kpódó Klísu kpó, bɔ é sɔ́ hwɛ e mǐ hu lɛ́ɛ bǐ kɛ mǐ.

"having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross. ","Wěma e jí è wlǎn hwɛ mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ dó, bɔ è ɖo hwɛ dó mǐ wɛ, bɔ tito tɔn lɛ́ɛ ma sɔgbe xá mǐ ǎ ɔ́, Mawu ká wěma ɔ́ nyi aklúzu jí, bó súnsún hwɛ mǐtɔn e ɖ'é jí lɛ́ɛ bǐ. "
"And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross. ","Klísu yí hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n sín gǎn lɛ́ɛ kpódó acɛkpikpa lɛ́ɛ kpó sí, gbɔn kú e é kú ɖo aklúzu jí ɔ́ gbla mɛ; é ɖu ɖo yě jí, bó bɛ́ yě kɔn nyi togun mɛ agbawungba, bɔ yě húzú nǔkpínkpɔ́n. "
"Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day. ","Ényí mɔ̌ hǔn, mi ma lɔn nú mɛɖé ní ɖɔ nú mi ɖɔ nǔ lě wɛ nyɔ́ bɔ mi ná ɖu, abǐ nǔ lě wɛ nyɔ́ bɔ mi ná nu, abǐ xwezán lě wɛ mi ná nyi, sun wá jǐ sín azǎn lě wɛ mi ná nyi, abǐ gbɔjɛzán Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn lě wɛ mi ná nyi ó. "
"These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ. ","Nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɔ́, nǔ ɖagbe e jǎwe ɔ́ sín yɛ kpowun wɛ yě nyǐ; lo ɔ́, Klísu wɛ nyí nǔjɔnǔ ɔ́. "
"Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you for the prize. Such a person goes into great detail about what he has seen, and his unspiritual mind puffs him up with idle notions. ","Mi ma lɔn nú mɛ e nɔ hun xomɛ ɖo mɛɖéesɔ́hwe ɖo wějí sín nǔwiwa lɛ́ɛ kpódó wɛnsagun lɛ́ɛ sinsɛn kpán mɛ ɔ́, ɖě ní ɖó hwɛ nú mi ó; mɛ mɔ̌hun ɔ́, nǔmimɔ e é nɔ mɔ lɛ́ɛ wú wɛ é nɔ gán jɛ, bɔ linlin gbɛtɔ́ tɔn e é nɔ ɖó lɛ́ɛ nɔ zɔ́n bɔ goyíyí dó wǔvɔ́ nɔ gbɛ́ dó e.

"He has lost connection with the Head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow. ","Mɛ énɛ́ nɔ tɛ́ dó Klísu e nyí ta ɔ́ wú ǎ.

"Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of this world, why, as though you still belonged to it, do you submit to its rules: ","Mi kpó Klísu kpó kó kú, bɔ è ko hwlɛ́n mi sín yɛ e kpa acɛ ɖo gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ sín hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n sí.

“Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!”? ,“Ma zé nǔ lě ó! Ma dó nǔ lě nu ó! Ma ɖó alɔ nǔ lě wú ó!” 
"These are all destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings. ","Nǔ e è zǎn tlóló ɔ́, é nɔ vɔ ɔ́ wɛ sɛ́n énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ kan; gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ sín sɛ́n kpódó nǔ e yě nɔ́ kplɔ́n mɛ lɛ́ɛ kpán wɛ nyí nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ. "
"Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, è kpɔ́n sɛ́n énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɔ́, è nɔ mɔ ɖɔ nǔnywɛ́ ɖ'é mɛ, ɖó yě nɔ́ ɖɔ sinsɛn mɛ ɖésúnɔ tɔn, mɛɖéesɔ́hwe kpó ya dó nú agbaza mɛ ɖésúnɔ tɔn kpó sín xó.

"Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. ",Nǔ e nyí sɛ́xwé tɔn lɛ́ɛ ní nɔ́ myá nukún nú mi
"For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. ","Đó mi kú, bɔ gbɛ mitɔn kpó Klísu tɔn kpó ɖo hwlǎhwlá ɖo Mawu mɛ. "
"When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. ","Gbɛ jɔ gbɛ mitɔn ɔ́, Klísu wɛ, bɔ hwenu e é ná wá tɔ́n ɔ́, mi lɔmɔ̌ kpó é kpó ná tɔ́n ɖo susu tɔn mɛ. "
"Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. ","Hǔn, mi bo sú nǔ e nyí ayǐkúngban jí tɔn ɖo ayi mitɔn mɛ lɛ́ɛ sín kún dó; nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ wɛ nyí: agalilɛ, nǔblíblíwiwa, jlǒ agbaza tɔn lɛ́ɛ, linlin nyanya lɛ́ɛ kpó nukúnkɛndídó kpó, ɖó nukúnkɛndídó ɔ́ cí bǒcyɔ sinsɛn ɖɔhun.

"Because of these, the wrath of God is coming. ",Nǔwanyido mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn lɛ́ɛ wútu wɛ xomɛsin Mawu tɔn ná kɔn nyi mɛ e ma nɔ se tónú n'i ǎ lɛ́ɛ jí.

"But now you must rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips. ","Amɔ̌ din ɔ́, mi jó nǔ élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ wiwa dó: mi ma nɔ sin xomɛ ó; mi ma nɔ dó xomɛsin nú mɛ ó; mi ma nɔ nylá hun ó; mi ma nɔ zun mɛ ó, abǐ xó gblégblé ɖé ní ma nɔ tɔ́n sín nu mitɔn mɛ ó. "
"Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices ","Mi ma nɔ ɖó nǔvú nú miɖée ó, ɖó mi ko ɖe gbɛtɔ́ xóxó e mi nyí ɖ'ayǐ ɔ́ kpódó walɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpán nyi ayǐ; "

"Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all.

"Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. ","Mɛɖeɖóvo Mawu tɔn wɛ mi nyí.

Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. ,"Mi nɔ mɔ miɖée gbɔ; ényí mɛɖé wa nǔ nyi do nú mɛɖé ɖo mi mɛ hweɖěbǔnu hǔn, mi nɔ sɔ́ kɛ miɖée. Mi ɖó ná nɔ sɔ́ hwɛ kɛ miɖée lě e Aklúnɔ sɔ́ kɛ mi é ɖɔhun. "
"And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity. ","Mi sɔ́ wǎn yíyí gbá dó nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ jí; ɖó wǎn yíyí ɔ́ wɛ nɔ dɔn nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ cá, bɔ yě nɔ́ nɔ bǔ ganjí. "
"Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. ","Fífá Klísu tɔn ní ɖu gǎn ɖo ayi mitɔn mɛ; nǔgbó ɔ́, fífá énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ Mawu ylɔ́ mi ɖó kpɔ́, bɔ mi nyí wǔjɔnú agbaza ɖokpó géé tɔn. Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, mi tunwun nǔ e Mawu wa nú mi ɔ́ n'i. "
"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God.

"And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.

"Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them. ","Súnnu lɛ́ɛ mi, mi yí wǎn nú asi mitɔn lɛ́ɛ; mi ma nylá hun dó yě ó. "
"Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. ","Vǐ lɛ́ɛ mi, mi se tónú nú mɛjitɔ́ mitɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖo nǔ bǐ mɛ, ɖó nǔ e nɔ nyɔ́ Aklúnɔ nukún mɛ é nɛ́. "

"Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to win their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord.

since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving. ,"Mi tunwun ɖɔ ɖagbe e Aklúnɔ sɔ́ ɖ'ayǐ nú mɛ e nyí étɔn lɛ́ɛ é ɔ́, émí ná ɖó ɖ'é mɛ, bɔ é ná nyí ajɔ mitɔn; ɖó Klísu wɛ nyí gǎn e wa azɔ̌ ná wɛ mi ɖe tawun é. "
"Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for his wrong, and there is no favoritism.Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, because you know that you also have a Master in heaven.

"For we know, brothers loved by God, that he has chosen you, ","Nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, mǐ tunwun ɖɔ Mawu yí wǎn nú mi, bó sɔ́ mi nú mi ná nyí étɔn. "
"because our gospel came to you not simply with words, but also with power, with the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction. You know how we lived among you for your sake.

"The Lord's message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia–your faith in God has become known everywhere.

"On the contrary, we speak as men approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel. We are not trying to please men but God, who tests our hearts. ","É nyɔ́ wa ɔ́, lě e Mawu jló gbɔn ɔ́ wɛ mǐ nɔ ɖɔ xó gbɔn hwebǐnu, ɖó é mɔ ɖɔ mǐ hɛn ɔ́, mǐ ná jlá Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́, bó sɔ́ dó así nú mǐ; gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ sí ba ná nyɔ́ ɖe wɛ mǐ ɖe, bó ɖo Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ jlá wɛ ǎ; lo ɔ́, Mawu e nɔ gbéjé linlin e ɖo ayi mǐtɔn mɛ ɔ́ kpɔ́n ɔ́ sí ba ná nyɔ́ ɖe wɛ mǐ ɖe.

"We were not looking for praise from men, not from you or anyone else. As apostles of Christ we could have been a burden to you, ","Mǐ wa nǔɖé bó dó ɖɔ mɛɖé ní kpa mǐ ǎ; é ná bo nyí midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ oo, é ná bo nyí mɛɖěvo lɛ́ɛ oo, mǐ ba ǎ. "

"Surely you remember, brothers, our toil and hardship; we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of God to you. ","Nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, lě e mǐ jɛ tagba, bó wa azɔ̌ gbɔn ɖo tɛ́ntin mitɔn ɔ́, mi flín ǎ cé? Mǐ ɖo Wɛn Ɖagbe Mawu tɔn ɔ́ jlá mi wɛ, bó ka nɔ wa azɔ̌ zǎn kpó kéze kpó, ɖó mǐ jló ná nɔ kɔ jí nú mi mɛ ɖěbǔ ǎ.

"You are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous and blameless we were among you who believed. ","Mi ná ɖe kúnnu ná, bɔ Mawu lɔmɔ̌ ná ɖe kúnnu ná ɖɔ gbɛ mímɛ́, gbɛ jlɔ́jlɔ́, gbɛ e mɛɖé ma ná mɔ nǔjɛdo ɖé ɖɔ d'é wú ǎ ɔ́ wɛ mǐ zán ɖo tɛ́ntin mitɔn. "

"And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is at work in you who believe. ","Mǐ nɔ lɛ́ gɔn kú dó nú Mawu ɖó nǔ élɔ́ wú ǎ; é wɛ nyí ɖɔ hwenu e mǐ jlá Mawuxó ɔ́ mi ɔ́, mi se lobo yí dó ayi mɛ; mi ka yí dó yí gbɛtɔ́ xó ǎ; lo ɔ́ mi yí dó yí Mawuxó ná; Mawuxó ɔ́ wɛ é ka nyí nǔgbó; ée mi yí i mɔ̌ ɔ́, é ɖo azɔ̌ wa ɖo mi mɛ e ɖi nǔ lɛ́ɛ mɛ wɛ.

"For you, brothers, became imitators of God's churches in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus: You suffered from your own countrymen the same things those churches suffered from the Jews, ","Nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, nǔ e gbo agun e ɖo Judée, bó nyí Mawu tɔn ɖo bǔ e mǐ ɖe xá Klísu Jezu ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́ wɛ gbo mi lɔmɔ̌.

who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to all men ,"Jwifu lɛ́ɛ wɛ hu Aklúnɔ Jezu, lobo hu gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ, bó nya mǐ. Yě dó xomɛsin nú Mawu, bó nyí kɛntɔ́ gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ tɔn. "
in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit. The wrath of God has come upon them at last. ,"Yě nɔ dó gǎn, bó ná glɔ́n ali nú mǐ, bónú mǐ má kpé wú, bó jlá Wɛn Ɖagbe e ná zɔ́n, bɔ mɛ e ma nyí Jwifu ǎ lɛ́ɛ ná mɔ hwlɛngán é ó.

"But, brothers, when we were torn away from you for a short time (in person, not in thought), out of our intense longing we made every effort to see you. ","Nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, nǔ e kan mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ: sín hwenu e mǐ ko gosín mi gɔn nú hwenu yɔywɛ ɖé ɔ́, é jló mǐ ɖésú ɖɔ mǐ ní lɛ́ mɔ mi; énɛ́ wú wɛ mǐ lɛ́ vɔ́ gǎn dó d'é jí, bó ná sixú kpé wú; mǐ sɔ́ ɖo kpɔ́ xá mi ɖo agbaza mɛ ǎ; lo ɔ́, ayi mǐtɔn ɖo mi wú.

"For we wanted to come to you–certainly I, Paul, did, again and again–but Satan stopped us. ","Mǐ ko jló ná lɛ́ wá mi gɔ́n; ɖo tají ɔ́, nyɛ Pɔ́lu ɔ́, azɔn mɔ̌kpán wɛ un tɛ́nkpɔ́n bó ná lɛ́ wá mi gɔ́n; lo ɔ́, Satáan ka sú ali tɔn dó mǐ. "
"For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you? ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, nukún mǐtɔn sɔ́ ɖo mɛɖé jí zɛ midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ kɛ́ɖɛ́ wú ǎ; mi jí wɛ nukún mǐtɔn ɖe; mi wɛ nyí xomɛhunhun mǐtɔn, bó nyí ɖuɖéjí mǐtɔn sín xlɛ́ e wú mǐ ná sixú tɛ afɔ ayǐ ɖo Aklúnɔ mǐtɔn Jezu nukɔn, ɖo hwenu e é ná lɛ́ kɔ wá é.

"We sent Timothy, who is our brother and God's fellow worker in spreading the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith, ","bó sɛ́ nɔví mǐtɔn Timɔtée e kpó mǐ kpó ɖo Wɛn Ɖagbe e ɖɔ xó dó Klísu wú ɔ́ jlá wɛ, bó dó ɖo azɔ̌ wa nú Mawu wɛ ɔ́ dó mi.

so that no one would be unsettled by these trials. You know quite well that we were destined for them. ,"bónú mi ma jó miɖée dó nú ya e ji wɛ mǐ ɖe ɔ́ ní dán mɛ ɖokpó ɖo mi mɛ ó; ɖó mi ɖésúnɔ ɔ́, mi ko tunwun ɖɔ ya énɛ́ e ji wɛ mǐ ɖe ɔ́, tito Mawu tɔn mɛ wɛ é ko ɖe nú mǐ. "
"In fact, when we were with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted. And it turned out that way, as you well know. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, hwenu e mǐ kpo ɖo mi gɔ́n ɔ́, mǐ ko ɖɔ nú mi ɖ'ayǐ ɖɔ mǐ ná ji ya; nǔ énɛ́ wɛ ɖo jijɛ wɛ din; mi ɖésúnɔ ɔ́, mi tunwun ganjí. "
"For this reason, when I could stand it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith. I was afraid that in some way the tempter might have tempted you and our efforts might have been useless. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wútu ɔ́, ée un ma sɔ́ sixú nɔ te ǎ ɔ́, un sɛ́ Timɔtée dó mi, bónú é ná wá kpɔ́n lě e nǔɖiɖi mitɔn ɖe gbɔn é, ɖó un ɖo xɛsi ɖi wɛ ɖɔ awǒvi ní ma wá tɛ́n mi kpɔ́n nú mi jɛ mɔɖónúmɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ, bónú azɔ̌ e mǐ wa ɖo tɛ́ntin mitɔn ɔ́ nyí nǔ yǎyá ó. "
"But Timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love. He has told us that you always have pleasant memories of us and that you long to see us, just as we also long to see you. ","Amɔ̌ din ɔ́, Timɔtée ko lɛ́ kɔ sín mi gɔ́n wá, bó ɖɔ xó ɖagbe nú mǐ dó nǔɖiɖi mitɔn kpó wǎn yíyí e mi ɖó nú miɖée ɔ́ kpó wú.

"Therefore, brothers, in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about you because of your faith. ","Nɔví mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ mi, adǎn ɖo mǐ gbo wɛ, bɔ mǐ ɖo wǔvɛ́ mɔ wɛ mɔ̌ có, xó mitɔn e mǐ se ɔ́ ná akɔ́nkpinkpan mǐ. Nǔɖiɖi e mi ɖó ɔ́ wɛ ná akɔ́nkpinkpan mǐ. "
"For now we really live, since you are standing firm in the Lord. ","Din ɔ́, ényí mi syɛ́nlǐn ɖo kɔnɖókpɔ́ e mi ɖó xá Aklúnɔ ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, hǔn mǐ ɖo gbɛ nǔgbó. "
How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our God because of you? ,"Xomɛ e hun mǐ ɖo Mawu mǐtɔn nukɔn ɖó mi wútu ɔ́, mǐ tunwun lě e mǐ ná dó kú n'i gbɔn dó ta mitɔn mɛ, bɔ é ná jɛ mɛ é ǎ. "
Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what is lacking in your faith. ,"Zǎn kpó kéze kpó ɔ́, mǐ nɔ́ byɔ́ ɛ syɛ́nsyɛ́n ɖɔ ní bló bónú mǐ ɖésúnɔ ná lɛ́ mɔ mi, bónú nǔ e lɛ́ hwedó mi ɖo nǔɖiɖi mitɔn mɛ ɔ́, mǐ ná gɔ́ ná nú mi. "
Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us to come to you. ,"Mawu Tɔ́ mǐtɔn ɔ́ ɖésú kpódó Aklúnɔ mǐtɔn Jezu kpó ní kplá mǐ, bónú mǐ ná sixú wá mɔ mi. "
"May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else, just as ours does for you. ","Aklúnɔ ní bló bónú wǎn yíyí e mi ɖó nú miɖée, bó ɖó nú gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɔ́ ní nɔ ɖo jijɛ jí wɛ, bónú é ní cí wǎn yíyí e mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖó nú mi é ɖɔhun. "
"May he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones.Finally, brothers, we instructed you how to live in order to please God, as in fact you are living. Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more.

For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus. ,"Nǔgbó ɔ́, mi tunwun nǔ e Aklúnɔ Jezu ná gbe mǐ, bɔ mǐ kplɔ́n mi é. "
It is God's will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality,Fon

"For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life. ","Đó Mawu ylɔ́ mǐ, bónú mǐ ná wa nǔ blíblí ǎ; lo ɔ́, é ylɔ́ mǐ nú mǐ ná zán gbɛ mímɛ́. "
"Therefore, he who rejects this instruction does not reject man but God, who gives you his Holy Spirit. ","Hǔn, mɛ e hɔn nǔkplɔ́nmɛ énɛ́ nyi gbě ɔ́, é nyí gbɛtɔ́ wɛ é hɔn nyi gbě ǎ; lo ɔ́, Mawu e ná Yɛsinsɛn tɔn mi ɔ́ wɛ é hɔn nyi gbě. "
"Now about brotherly love we do not need to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love each other. ","É sɔ́ byɔ́ ɖɔ è nǎ wlán nǔɖé sɛ́ dó mi dó nɔví ɖo nǔɖiɖi mɛ sín wǎn e mi ɖó ná yí nú miɖée ɔ́ wú ǎ; ɖó lě e mi ná yí wǎn nú miɖée gbɔn ɔ́, Mawu ko kplɔ́n mi. "
"And in fact, you do love all the brothers throughout Macedonia. Yet we urge you, brothers, to do so more and more. ","Wǎn yíyí énɛ́ wɛ mi ɖó nú nɔví lɛ́ɛ gbɔn Masedwani to ɔ́ bǐ mɛ. Amɔ̌, nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, mǐ lɛ́ ɖo byɔ̌byɔ́ mi wɛ ɖɔ wǎn yíyí énɛ́ ní nɔ lɛ́ jɛjí ayǐhɔ́ngbe ayǐhɔ́ngbe. "
"Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business and to work with your hands, just as we told you, ","Mi dó gǎn, bónú fífá ní nɔ́ nɔ tɛ́ntin mitɔn; mi dó gǎn bó nɔ́ kpé nukún dó nǔ mi ɖésúnɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ wú; mi dó gǎn bó nɔ́ wa azɔ̌ kpó alɔ mi ɖésúnɔ tɔn kpó lě e mǐ kó ɖɔ nú mi gbɔn é. "
so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, mɛ e ma ɖo agun Klísu tɔn mɛ ǎ lɛ́ɛ ná nɔ ɖó sísí nú mi, bɔ mi ka ná nɔ kɔ jí nú mɛɖé ǎ. "
"Brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant about those who fall asleep, or to grieve like the rest of men, who have no hope. ","Nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, lě e mɛ e ko kú lɛ́ɛ xó ná wá nyí gbɔn ɔ́, mǐ jló ɖɔ mi ní mɔ nǔ jɛ mɛ céɖécéɖé, bónú mi ma nɔ aluwɛ mɛ mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ e ma ɖo nukún ɖó nǔɖé wɛ ǎ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔhun ó. "
We believe that Jesus died and rose again and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him. ,"Đó mǐ ɖi nǔ ɖɔ Jezu kú bó lɛ́ fɔ́n; mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, mǐ lɛ́ ɖi nǔ ɖɔ Mawu ná fɔ́n mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú Jezu cóbó kú lɛ́ɛ kpó é kpó. "
"According to the Lord's own word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left till the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, lě e Aklúnɔxó ɔ́ ɖɔ gbɔn ɔ́ ɖíe ɖɔ nú mi gbé wɛ mǐ ja e: mǐ mɛ e ná kpo ɖo gbɛ hwenu e Aklúnɔ ná wá dó ɔ́, mǐ ná jɛ nukɔn nú mɛ e ko kú lɛ́ɛ ǎ. "
"For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. ","Hwe ɔ́ nu su ɔ́, Aklúnɔ ɖésúnɔ ná jɛ te sín jǐxwé, bɔ è nǎ se mɛɖé ná ɖe gbe kpó xósúsú kpó, bó ná se wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn ɖaxó ɖokpó sín gbe; bó ná se ɖuɖéjí sín kpɛn Mawu tɔn sín gbe; bɔ mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú Klísu cóbó kú lɛ́ɛ ná fɔ́n jɛ nukɔn. "
"After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, mǐ mɛ e ná kpo ɖo gbɛ hwenɛ́nu lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, Mawu ná zé mǐ kpó yě kpó zɛ̌ɛ́n yi jǐ, ɖo akpɔ́kpɔ́ mɛ, bɔ mǐ ná yi kpé Aklúnɔ ɔ́ ɖo jɔhɔn mɛ; bɔ énɛ́ ɔ́, mǐ ná nɔ kpɔ́ xá Aklúnɔ ɔ́ hwebǐnu. "
"Therefore encourage each other with these words.Now, brothers, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, ","Hǔn mi bo zé xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ dó dó wǔsyɛ́n lanmɛ nú miɖée.Nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, hwenu e nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ná jɛ dó ɔ́, é sɔ́ byɔ́ ɖɔ è nǐ wlán nǔɖé d'é wú sɛ́ dó mi ǎ. "
for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. ,"Đó mi ɖésúnɔ ɔ́, mi tunwun ganjí ɖɔ Aklúnɔzán ɔ́ ná wá fyán mɛ lě e ajotɔ́ nɔ wá fyán mɛ zǎn mɛ é ɖɔhun. "
"While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. ","Hwenu e gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ na ɖɔ: “Fífá tíin, bɔ ayi jɛ ayǐ” ɔ́, hwe énɛ́ ɔ́ nu wɛ nǔ e ná vívá kún yětɔn ɔ́ ná zɔn yě jǐ ajijimɛ lě e nyɔ̌nu e ɖo xo ɔ́ nɔ jɛ flú mɛ ajijimɛ é ɖɔhun; yě ná gán ɖ'é mɛ ǎ. "
"But you, brothers, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. ","Amɔ̌, nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mi ɖo ablu mɛ, bónú azǎn énɛ́ ɔ́ ná wá fyán mi ajotɔ́ ɖɔhun ǎ. "
You are all sons of the light and sons of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. ,"Nǔgbó ɔ́, wěziza tɔn wɛ mi bǐ nyí, bó nyí kéze tɔn; mi nyí zǎn tɔn ǎ; mi ka nyí ablu tɔn ǎ. "
"So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be alert and self-controlled. ","Ényí mɔ̌ hǔn, mǐ ɖó ná dɔ́ amlɔ mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ ɖɔhun ǎ; lo ɔ́, mǐ ɖó ná nɔ wunzɛn; ayi mǐtɔn ní ɖo te. "
"For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. ","Đó mɛ e nɔ dɔ́ amlɔ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, zǎn mɛ wɛ yě nɔ dɔ́ amlɔ, bɔ mɛ e nɔ nu ahan mú lɛ́ɛ nɔ́ nu ahan mú zǎn mɛ. "
"But since we belong to the day, let us be self-controlled, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. ","Amɔ̌, mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, kéze tɔn wɛ mǐ nyí, bɔ ayi mǐtɔn ɖó ná nɔ te. Nǔɖiɖi kpó wǎn yíyí kpó ní nyí ganwu, bónú mǐ ní sɔ́ dó; hwlɛngán e ɖó nukún wɛ mǐ ɖe ɔ́ ní nyí gangbákún bónú mǐ ní sɔ́ xwe. "
For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. ,"Nǔgbó ɔ́, tito Mawu tɔn wɛ nyí ɖɔ é ná zé xomɛsin tɔn dó wa nǔ xá mǐ ǎ; lo ɔ́, tito tɔn wɛ nyí ɖɔ é ná hwlɛ́n mǐ gán, gbɔn Aklúnɔ mǐtɔn Jezu Klísu jí. "
"He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him. ","Đó Jezu Klísu kú dó ta mǐtɔn mɛ, nú mǐ kpo ɖo gbɛ oo, abǐ mǐ kó kú oo, mǐ ná nɔ gbɛ xá ɛ. "
"Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing. ","Hǔn, mi ná akɔ́nkpinkpan miɖée, bó dó wǔsyɛ́n lanmɛ nú miɖée, lě e bló gbɔn wɛ mi ko ɖe é. "
"Now we ask you, brothers, to respect those who work hard among you, who are over you in the Lord and who admonish you. ","Nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, mǐ ɖo byɔ̌byɔ́ mi wɛ ɖɔ mi nɔ ɖó sísí nú mɛ e Aklúnɔ sɔ́, bɔ yě ɖo azɔ̌ wa wɛ ɖo tɛ́ntin mitɔn lɛ́ɛ é; mɛ e Aklúnɔ sɔ́ azɔ̌ dó así ná, bɔ yě ɖo ali xlɛ́ mi wɛ, bó ɖo kplɔ́n ná mi wɛ lɛ́ɛ é.

Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other. ,"Mi nɔ wlí yɛ̌yi nú yě ganjí; mi ná yí wǎn nú yě titewungbe, ɖó azɔ̌ e wa wɛ yě ɖe ɔ́ wútu. Mi nɔ ɖó xomɛfífá dó miɖée wú. "

Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need. ,Kpé nukún dó asúkúsi e nyí asúkúsi nǔgbó nǔgbó lɛ́ɛ wú kpódó sísí kpó. 
"But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to God.

The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help. ,"Asúkúsi nǔgbó nǔgbó e ma ɖó mɛɖé bɔ é ná kpé nukún dó wútu tɔn ǎ ɔ́ nɔ sɔ́ nukúnɖíɖó tɔn bǐ ɖó Mawu jí. É nɔ gɔn ɖɛ xo ǎ, é nɔ gɔn vo sa nú Mawu ǎ. "

"If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. ","Ényí mɛɖé ma nɔ kpé nukún dó mɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ wú ǎ ɔ́, ɖo tají ɔ́, mɛ e ɖo hɛ̌n tɔn nu lɛ́ɛ wú ǎ ɔ́, mɛ énɛ́ ɔ́ gbɛ́ nǔɖiɖi, lobo nylá hú nǔmaɖitɔ́. "
"No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been faithful to her husband, ","Asúkúsi ɖé ma ɖó xwe kanɖé ko (60) jɛjí ǎ hǔn, ma lɛ́n ɛ dó asúkúsi lɛ́ɛ mɛ ó. É ka ná nyí mɛɖé, bɔ súnnu ɖokpó géé jɛ́n é ná da kpɔ́n. "

"As for younger widows, do not put them on such a list. For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry. ","Ma xa asúkúsi e ma ko nyí mɛxó ǎ lɛ́ɛ dó asúkúsi lɛ́ɛ mɛ ó; ɖó hwenu e asúdida nɔ jɛ yě jló jí ɔ́, yě nɔ lɛ́ kɔ sín Klísu gúdo. "

"Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things they ought not to.

Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan. ,"Đó asúkúsi ɖé lɛ́ɛ kó gosín ali jlɔ́jlɔ́ ɔ́ jí, bó xwedó Satáan. "
"If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family, she should help them and not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows who are really in need.

"Those who have believing masters are not to show less respect for them because they are brothers.

","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ un ɖo ya élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ji wɛ; é ka hu winnyá nú mì ǎ; ɖó un tunwun mɛ e un ɖi nǔ ná é, bó ka ɖó jiɖiɖe ɖɔ é ɖó hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n e ná hɛn nǔ e é sɔ́ dó así nú mǐ ɔ́ káká jɛ azǎn énɛ́ ɔ́ gbe. "
"What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus. ","Đó nǔɖiɖi kpódó wǎn yíyí e mǐ ɖó ɖo bǔ e mǐ ɖe xá Klísu Jezu ɔ́ kpán mɛ é wú ɔ́, hɛn xó jɔ xó e a se ɖo nu ce lɛ́ɛ é, bónú yě ní nyí kpɔ́ndéwú nú we. "
Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you–guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us. ,"Yɛsinsɛn e ɖo mǐ mɛ ɔ́ ní d'alɔ we, bónú a nǐ hɛn nǔkplɔ́nmɛ titewungbe e è sɔ́ dó así nú we lɛ́ɛ. "
"You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes. ","Lě e a ko tunwun gbɔn ɔ́, mɛ e ɖo Azíi yíkúngban jí lɛ́ɛ bǐ lɛ́ kɔ sín gǔdo ce; yě ɖě nɛ́ nyí Fijɛ́lu kpódó Ɛɛmɔjɛ́ni kpó nɛ́. "
"May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains. ","Aklúnɔ ní ɖe nǔbláwǔkúnúmɛ tɔn xlɛ́ hɛ̌nnu Onɛzifɔ́ɔ tɔn, ɖó é nɔ dó wǔsyɛ́n lanmɛ nú mì hwɛhwɛ; winnyá hu i ɖó nyɛ mɛ e ɖo gankpá mɛ ɔ́ wú ǎ. "
"On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me. ","É nyɔ́ wa ɔ́, hwenu e é wá Hlɔ̌ma ɔ́, é ba mì kpódó vǐvɛ́ dó nú nǔ kpó káká bó mɔ mì. "
"May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others. ,"Nǔ e un ɖɔ, bɔ a se ɖo kúnnuɖetɔ́ gěgé nukɔn ɔ́, sɔ́ dó así nú mɛ e wú è ɖeji dó, bɔ yě lɔ ná sixú kplɔ́n mɛɖěvo lɛ́ɛ é. "
Endure hardship with us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. ,Ji ya e nyí towe ɔ́ ahwanfuntɔ́ ɖagbe Klísu Jezu tɔn ɖɔhun. 
No one serving as a soldier gets involved in civilian affairs–he wants to please his commanding officer. ,"Ényí ahwanfuntɔ́ e ɖo ahwangbénu ɔ́ ɖě jló na nyɔ́ ɖo gǎn tɔn sí ɔ́, é nɔ bɛ́ gbɛmɛ kpaa sín nǔ lɛ́ɛ dó hǔn mɛ ǎ. "
"Similarly, if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not receive the victor's crown unless he competes according to the rules. ","Wezunkántɔ́ e yi agbahwlɛ́nhwlɛ́n tɛnmɛ ɔ́ ma kán wezun lě e sɛ́n ɔ́ zɔ́n gbɔn ɔ́ ǎ ɔ́, é sixú mɔ ɖuɖéjígbákún yí ǎ. "

"Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this. ","Lin tamɛ dó nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ un ɖe ɔ́ wú, ɖó Aklúnɔ ná nukúnnú-mɔjɛnǔmɛ we, bónú a nǎ sixú mɔ nukúnnú jɛ bǐ wú. "

for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God's word is not chained. ,Wɛn Ɖagbe énɛ́ wú wɛ un ɖo ya ji wɛ káká bɔ è dǒ wlɔ mì nǔ nyanya ɖé wɛ un wa ɖɔhun
"Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. ","Énɛ́ wú wɛ un nɔ dɛ ɖo nǔ bǐ nu, ɖó mɛ e Mawu cyán lɛ́ɛ wú, bónú yě lɔ ná sixú mɔ hwlɛngán e ɖo Klísu Jezu mɛ ɔ́ kpódó susu maɖókpodó kpó yí. "

"if we endure, we will also reign with him. If we disown him, he will also disown us; ","Ényí mǐ syɛ́nlǐn ɔ́, mǐ ná ɖu axɔ́sú xá ɛ. Ényí mǐ gbɛ́ ɖɔ mǐ kún tunwun i ó ɔ́, élɔ́ ná gbɛ́ ɖɔ émí kún tunwun mǐ ó. "
"if we are faithless, he will remain faithful, for he cannot disown himself. ","Ényí mǐ ma nɔ gbejí ǎ ɔ́, éyɛ́ ɖo gbejí tɛgbɛ; ɖó é sixú gbɛ́ ɖɔ émí kún nyí nǔ e émí nyí ɔ́ ó ǎ.” "
"Keep reminding them of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen.

"Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.” ","Nǔ ɖo mɔ̌ có dodó syɛ́nsyɛ́n Mawu tɔn ɔ́ ɖo te ganjí, bɔ xó élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ nyí wuntun bó ɖ'é wú: “Aklúnɔ tunwun mɛ e nyí étɔn lɛ́ɛ é!” “Mɛ ɖěbǔ ɖɔ émí nyí Aklúnɔ tɔn ɔ́, mɛ ɔ́ ɖó ná lɛ́ kɔ sín nǔ nyanya wiwa gúdo.” "
"In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for noble purposes and some for ignoble.

"And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful. ","Aklúnɔ sín mɛsɛntɔ́ ka ɖó ná ɖɔ jlɛ ǎ; é nyɔ́ wa ɔ́, mɛ bǐ wɛ é ɖó ná dɔn dó wǔ; é ɖó ná nyí mɛɖé bó ná sixú kplɔ́n nǔ mɛ; é ɖó ná nɔ kú hǔn. "

"Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these men oppose the truth–men of depraved minds, who, as far as the faith is concerned, are rejected.

","Amɔ̌, ɖo azǎn élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, éé ɖo azǎn gǔdo gúdo tɔn nyí wɛ lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɔ́, é ɖɔ xó nú mǐ gbɔn vǐ tɔn jí; é jí wɛ Mawu ɖó gbɛ ɔ́ gbɔn; é wɛ Mawu sɔ́, bó zé nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ dó así ná. "
"The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven. ","É wɛ nyí susu Mawu tɔn sín wěziza sín xlɛ́, bó nyí Mawu sín xlɛ́ titewungbe tɔn.

So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs. ,Vǐ ɔ́ wá hú gǎn wɛnsagun lɛ́ɛ lě e nyǐkɔ e Mawu ná ɛ ɔ́ ɖo tají hú wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ tɔn gbɔn é. 
"For to which of the angels did God ever say, “You are my Son; today I have become your Father ”? Or again, “I will be his Father, and he will be my Son”? ","Đó Mawu ɖɔ nú wɛnsagun tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖě gbeɖé ɖɔ: “Vǐ ce wɛ a nyǐ, bɔ égbé ɔ́, un ji we” ǎ. É ka ɖɔ dó wɛnsagun ɖé wú gbeɖé ɖɔ: “Un ná nyí tɔ́ n'i, bɔ éyɛ́ ná nyí vǐ nú mì” ǎ. "
"And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says, “Let all God's angels worship him.” ","Lo ɔ́, hwenu e Mawu ná sɛ́ nukɔngbéví tɔn dó gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, é ɖɔ: “Wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɖó ná ɖe kɔ́ n'i.” "
"In speaking of the angels he says, “He makes his angels winds, his servants flames of fire.” ","Nǔ e Mawu ɖɔ dó wɛnsagun lɛ́ɛ wú ɔ́ ɖíe: “Mawu nɔ sɔ́ wɛnsagun tɔn lɛ́ɛ dó húzú jɔhɔn, bó nɔ́ sɔ́ mɛsɛntɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ dó húzú myɔ.” "
"But about the Son he says, “Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom. ","Lo ɔ́, Mawu ɖɔ dó vǐ ɔ́ wú ɖɔ: “Óo! Mawu, axɔ́súzinkpo towe ɖo te káká sɔ́yi. Hwɛjijɔ jí wɛ axɔ́súɖuɖu towe jínjɔ́n. "
"You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy.” ","A yǐ wǎn nú hwɛjijɔ, bó gbɛ́ wǎn nú nǔ nyanya; énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ Mawu, Mawu towe kɔn awǎjijɛ sín ami dó ta nú we, bó dó sɔ́ we bɔ a hú gǎn hǎgbɛ́ towe lɛ́ɛ.” "
"He also says, “In the beginning, O Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. ","É lɛ́ ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ, hwi wɛ ɖó ayǐkúngban ɔ́ ayǐ sín do, bɔ jǐxwé ɔ́ nyí alɔ towe núwiwa. "
"They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. ",Nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ná vɔ
"You will roll them up like a robe; like a garment they will be changed. But you remain the same, and your years will never end.” ","A nǎ mlá yě awu ɖaxó ɖɔhun, bɔ è nǎ ɖyɔ́ yě avɔ ɖɔhun. Amɔ̌ hwɛ ɔ́, nǔ ɖokpó ɔ́ wɛ a nyǐ tɛgbɛ, bɔ gbɛ towe ɖó vivɔ ǎ.” "
"To which of the angels did God ever say, “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet”? ",Mawu ɖɔ nú wɛnsagun tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖě gbeɖé ɖɔ: “Jǐnjɔ́n ɖisí ce xwé fí káká nú ma sɔ́ kɛntɔ́ towe lɛ́ɛ dó húzú afɔɖótɛn nú we” ǎ. 
"Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?We must pay more careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away. ","Étɛ́ wɛnsagun lɛ́ɛ ka nyí lo? Yɛ wɛ yě bǐ nyí, bó ɖo azɔ̌ wa nú Mawu wɛ, bɔ Mawu sɛ́ yě dó nú yě ná wá dó alɔ mɛ e ɖó ná mɔ hwlɛngán lɛ́ɛ.Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ mǐ ɖó ná hɛn nǔgbó e mǐ se lɛ́ɛ syɛ́nsyɛ́n hú ɖ'ayǐ tɔn, bónú è ma wá dɔn mǐ ɖó zɔ nú nǔgbó ɔ́ ó. "
"For if the message spoken by angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment, ","Đó xó e wɛnsagun lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ ɔ́ lí dǒ sɔ mɔ̌, bɔ mɛɖé ma ké ya ná ǎ, abǐ mɛɖé vɛ́ tóli ná ɔ́, è nɔ dɔn tó nú mɛ ɔ́, lě e é jɛ xá gbɔn é. "
"how shall we escape if we ignore such a great salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him. ","Ényí nǔ nyí mɔ̌ ɔ́, nú mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ dó vɛ̌ nú hwlɛngán ɖaxó énɛ́ ɔ́, nɛ̌ mǐ ka ná sixú gló tódɔnnúmɛ ɔ́ gbɔn?

"God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will. ","Azɔn ɖokpó ɔ́, Mawu ɖe wuntun tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ lɛ́ɛ xlɛ́, bó jlɛ́ nǔ tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ kpódó nǔdábaɖa tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ kpó gbɔn yě jí, bó dó ɖe xlɛ́ ɖɔ émí yí gbe nú kúnnuɖiɖe yětɔn.

"It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, ényí wɛnsagun lɛ́ɛ wɛ Mawu ná acɛ dó gbɛ́ e jǎwe, bɔ mǐ ɖo xó tɔn ɖɔ wɛ ɔ́ nu ǎ. "
"But there is a place where someone has testified: “What is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him? ","É nyɔ́ wa ɔ́, mɛɖé ko ɖɔ ɖo Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ɖo akpá ɖé xwé ɖɔ: “Étɛ́ gbɛtɔ́ ka nyí bɔ a nǎ flín i? Étɛ́ vǐ e gbɛtɔ́ ji ɔ́ ka nyí, bɔ a nǎ kpé nukún wǔ tɔn. "
You made him a little lower than the angels,Fon
"and put everything under his feet.” In putting everything under him, God left nothing that is not subject to him. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to him. ","A sɔ́ nǔ bǐ dó afɔ tɔn glɔ́.” Ée è ɖɔ Mawu sɔ́ nǔ bǐ dó acɛ tɔn mɛ ɔ́, é xlɛ́ ɖɔ nǔ ɖěbǔ kún ɖe bɔ é gɔn acɛ tɔn mɛ sɔ́ ɖó ó. É ka ɖo mɔ̌ có, mǐ kó ɖo mimɔ wɛ din ɖɔ é ɖó acɛ ɖo nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ nu ǎ. "
"But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone. ","Nǔ e mɔ wɛ mǐ ɖe ɔ́ ɖíe: Mawu sɔ́ Jezu hwe ɖo wɛnsagun lɛ́ɛ glɔ́ nú hwenu kpɛɖé, bónú é ní kú dó gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ tamɛ gbɔn fɛ́nú Mawu tɔn gbla mɛ, bɔ mǐ ka ɖo mimɔ ɛ wɛ din bɔ è sɔ́ susu kpódó yɛ̌yi kpán sín axɔ́súgbákún xwe n'i ɖó ya e é ji, bó kú ɔ́ wú. "
"In bringing many sons to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, é jɛ xá hwenɛ́nu ɖɔ Mawu e bló nǔ bǐ, bó hɛn nǔ bǐ ɖó tɛn yětɔn yětɔn mɛ ɔ́, ní bló nú Jezu ní mɛ́ yí fó, gbɔn wǔvɛ́mimɔ gbla mɛ.

Both the one who makes men holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers. ,"Jezu e nɔ slá wǔ nú mɛ ɔ́ kpódó mɛ e é slá wǔ ná lɛ́ɛ kpó ɔ́, tɔ́ ɖokpó ɔ́ wɛ ɖó yě bǐ. Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ winnyá ma hu Jezu nú é ná ylɔ́ yě ɖɔ nɔví émítɔn lɛ́ɛ ǎ. "
"He says, “I will declare your name to my brothers; in the presence of the congregation I will sing your praises.” ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, é ɖɔ nú Mawu ɖɔ: “Un ná jlá nǔ e a wa lɛ́ɛ nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ; un ná mlá we ɖo agun ɔ́ tɛ́ntin.” "
"And again, “I will put my trust in him.” And again he says, “Here am I, and the children God has given me.” ",É lɛ́ ɖɔ: “Un ná ɖeji dó Mawu wú.” Bó lɛ́ vɔ ɖɔ: “Nyɛ kpó vǐ e Mawu ná mì lɛ́ɛ kpán ɖíe.” 
"Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death–that is, the devil– ","Ée ényí ɖɔ vǐ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, gbɛtɔ́ wɛ yě nyǐ, bó ɖó agbaza kpó hun kpó ɔ́, Jezu ɖésú húzú gbɛtɔ́, bó ɖó agbaza kpó hun kpó yě ɖɔhun.

and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death. ,"énɛ́ ɔ́, é hwlɛ́n mɛ e cí kannumɔ ɖɔhun ɖo gbɛzán yětɔn bǐ mɛ, ɖó xɛsi e ɖi nú kú wɛ yě ɖe ɔ́ wútu lɛ́ɛ gán. "
"For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants. ","Đó é ɖo gaan ɖɔ é kún nyí wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ wɛ é d'alɔ ó; lo ɔ́, Ablaxámu ví lɛ́ɛ wɛ é d'alɔ. "
"For this reason he had to be made like his brothers in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ é ɖó ná húzú, bó cí nɔví tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔhun ɖo ali lɛ́ɛ bǐ nu, bó ná sixú nyí vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó, gbejínɔtɔ́, kpódó nǔbláwǔkúnúmɛtɔ́ kpó ɖo mawuzɔ́ e wa wɛ é ɖe ɔ́ mɛ, bónú Mawu ná sɔ́ hwɛ e togun ɔ́ hu lɛ́ɛ kɛ ɛ. "
"Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess. ","Bɔ din ɔ́, é hɛn ɔ́, é ná dó alɔ mɛ e è tɛ́nkpɔ́n lɛ́ɛ, ɖó è ko tɛ́n é ɖésúnɔ kpɔ́n, bɔ é ko ji ya.Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, nɔví klísusɛntɔ́ lɛ́ɛ mi, mi mɛ e Mawu ylɔ́ lɛ́ɛ lɔ ɔ́, nukún mitɔn ní nɔ Jezu wú; é wɛ nyí Mɛsɛ́dó Mawu tɔn, bó nyí vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó e hɛn nǔɖiɖi e jlá wɛ mǐ ɖe ɔ́ wá nú mǐ é.

"He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God's house. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, é nɔ gbejí nú Mawu e sɔ́ ɛ nú azɔ̌ énɛ́ ɔ́, Mɔyízi e wú è ɖɔ xó élɔ́ dó ɔ́ ɖɔhun: “É nɔ gbejí ɖo Mawu sín xwédo ɔ́ bǐ mɛ.” "
"Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself. ",Mɛ lɛ́ɛ nɔ kpa susu nú mɛ e gbá xɔ ɔ́ hú xɔ ɔ́ ɖésú. Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́ wɛ susu e jɛ xá Jezu ɔ́ hú gǎn Mɔyízi tɔn. 
"For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, è mɔ xɔ ɖé ɖo te hǔn, mɛɖé jɛ́n gbá; Mawu wɛ ka nyí mɛ e bló nǔ bǐ é. "
"Moses was faithful as a servant in all God's house, testifying to what would be said in the future. ","Mɔyízi éyɛ́ ɔ́, mɛsɛntɔ́ ɖɔhun ɔ́, é nɔ gbejí ɖo Mawu sín xwédo ɔ́ bǐ mɛ, bó ná nyí kúnnuɖetɔ́ nú nǔ e è ɖǒ ná ɖɔ é. "
"But Christ is faithful as a son over God's house. And we are his house, if we hold on to our courage and the hope of which we boast. ","Amɔ̌ Klísu ɔ́, ɖi vǐ ɖɔhun ɔ́, é nɔ gbejí nú Mawu, bɔ Mawu sɔ́ ɛ ɖó xwédo tɔn nu.

"So, as the Holy Spirit says: “Today, if you hear his voice, ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, mi cɔ́ miɖée, lě e Yɛsinsɛn ɖɔ gbɔn é; Yɛsinsɛn ɖɔ: “Ényí mi se Mawu sín gbe égbé din hǔn, "
"do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion, during the time of testing in the desert, ",mi ma tlí tó hwenu e mi fɔ́n gǔ dó jǐ tɔn é ɖɔhun ó
where your fathers tested and tried me and for forty years saw what I did. ,"Tɔ́gbó mitɔn lɛ́ɛ tɛ́n mì kpɔ́n ɖo fínɛ́, có yě ká mɔ nǔwiwa ce lɛ́ɛ káká nú xwe kanɖé (40). "
"That is why I was angry with that generation, and I said, ‘Their hearts are always going astray, and they have not known my ways.’ ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ xomɛ sin mì dó mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ wú, bɔ un ɖɔ: ‘Ayi yětɔn nɔ ɖo ali bú wɛ hwebǐnu. Yě mɔ nukúnnú jɛ nǔ e ba nú yě wɛ un ɖe ɔ́ wú ǎ.’ "
"So I declared on oath in my anger, ‘They shall never enter my rest.’ ” ","Đo xomɛsin ce mɛ ɔ́, un xwlé nǔ bó ɖɔ: ‘Yě ná byɔ́ to e mɛ un ná ná gbɔjɛ́ yě ɖe ɔ́ mɛ gbeɖé ǎ.’ ” "
"See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. ","Nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, mi cɔ́ miɖée, bónú mɛɖé má ɖo mi mɛ, bó ɖó ayi nyanya, ayi e ma nɔ ɖi nǔ ǎ é, bó lɛ́ kɔ sín Mawu gbɛɖe ɔ́ gúdo ó. "
"But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness. ","É nyɔ́ wa ɔ́, mi nɔ ná akɔ́nkpinkpan miɖée ayǐhɔ́ngbe ayǐhɔ́ngbe káká yi jɛ hwenu e “Égbé din” e xó è ɖɔ dó Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́ ná ɖo azɔ̌ wa dó mǐ jí wɛ yi jɛ é, bónú ɖokpó mitɔn ma jó éɖée dó nú hwɛhuhu flú i, bónú é wá húzú tótlítɔ́ ó. "
We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly till the end the confidence we had at first. ,"Nǔgbó ɔ́, ényí mǐ hɛn jiɖiɖe e mǐ ɖó sín bǐbɛ́mɛ ɔ́ syɛ́nsyɛ́n káká yi fó hǔn, mǐ nyí hǎgbɛ́ Klísu tɔn. "
"As has just been said: “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion.” ","Nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖe ɔ́ ɖíe: “Ényí mi se Mawu sín gbe égbé din hǔn, mi ma tlí tó hwenu e mi fɔ́n gǔ dó jǐ tɔn ɔ́ ɖɔhun ó.” "
Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt? ,Mɛ̌ e mɛ̌ e ka se Mawu sín gbe bó fɔ́n gǔ dó jǐ tɔn? Yě mɛ e Mɔyízi ɖe tɔ́n sín Ejípu lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ. 
"And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert? ","Mɛ̌ e mɛ̌ e Mawu ka sin xomɛ dó káká nú xwe kanɖé? Mɛ e hu hwɛ, bó j'ayǐ bó kú ɖo gbětótló mɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ. "
And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed? ,"Hwenu e Mawu xwlé nǔ bó ɖɔ: “Yě ná byɔ́ to e mɛ un ná ná gbɔjɛ́ yě ɖe ɔ́ mɛ gbeɖé ǎ” ɔ́, mɛ̌ e mɛ̌ e xó ɖɔ wɛ é ka ɖe? Mɛ e fɔ́n gǔ lɛ́ɛ xó ɖɔ wɛ é ɖe. "
"So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief.Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, mǐ mɔ ɖɔ yě kún kpé wú, bó byɔ́ gbɔjɛ́ énɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ ó, ɖó nǔ e yě ma ɖi ǎ é wútu.Ée akpá e Mawu dó nú mǐ ɖɔ mǐ ná byɔ́ fí e émí ná ná gbɔjɛ́ mǐ ɖe ɔ́ lɛ́ kpo ɖo te ɔ́, hǔn mǐ ní bó cɔ́ mǐɖée, bónú mi mɛ ɖěbǔ ní ma gɔn gbɔjɛ́ énɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ byɔ́ ó. "
"For we also have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith. ","Đó mǐ se Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ lě e mɛ e ɖo gbětótló mɛ ɖ'ayǐ lɛ́ɛ se gbɔn é. Yě se wɛn énɛ́ ɔ́; é ka wa ɖagbe ɖé nú yě ǎ; ɖó hwenu e yě se ɔ́, yě yí kpó nǔɖiɖi kpó ǎ. "
"Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, “So I declared on oath in my anger, ‘They shall never enter my rest.’ ” And yet his work has been finished since the creation of the world. ","Mǐ mɛ e ɖi nǔ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mǐ ná byɔ́ gbɔjɛ́ énɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ; gbɔjɛ́ énɛ́ e wú Mawu ɖɔ xó dó bó ɖɔ: “Đo xomɛsin ce mɛ ɔ́, un xwlé nǔ bó ɖɔ: ‘Yě ná byɔ́ to e mɛ un ná ná gbɔjɛ́ yě ɖe ɔ́ mɛ gbeɖé ǎ.’ ” Xó e Mawu ɖɔ é nɛ́; é ká kó wa azɔ̌ tɔn fó sín hwenu e é ko ɖó gbɛ ɔ́ dó é ɖokpóó. "
For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: “And on the seventh day God rested from all his work.” ,"Đó è ko ɖɔ xó dó azǎn tɛ́nwegɔ́ ɔ́ wú, ɖo akpá ɖé xwé ɖo Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ɖɔ: “Ée Mawu bló nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ fó ɔ́, é gbɔjɛ́ azǎn tɛ́nwegɔ́ ɔ́ gbe.” "
"And again in the passage above he says, “They shall never enter my rest.” ",É lɛ́ ɖɔ ɖo aga ɖɔ: “Yě ná byɔ́ to e mɛ un bló gbɔjɛtɛn ɖ'ayǐ nú yě ɖe ɔ́ mɛ gbeɖé ǎ.” 
"It still remains that some will enter that rest, and those who formerly had the gospel preached to them did not go in, because of their disobedience. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, mɛ ɖěvo lɛ́ɛ hɛn ɔ́, yě ná byɔ́ mɛ, ɖó mɛ nukɔntɔn e se Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ lɛ́ɛ byɔ́ gbɔjɛ́ énɛ́ mɛ ǎ, ɖó yě tlí tó. "
"Therefore God again set a certain day, calling it Today, when a long time later he spoke through David, as was said before: “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ Mawu lɛ́ ɖó azǎn ɖěvo; è nɔ ylɔ́ azǎn énɛ́ ɖɔ “Égbé din”. É lín káká, bɔ é lɛ́ wá ɖɔ azǎn énɛ́ sín xó gbɔn Davídi jí, ɖo Ɖɛhanwéma tɔn e mǐ ko mɔ wá yi é mɛ ɖɔ: “Ényí mi se Mawu sín gbe égbé din hǔn, mi ma tlí tó ó.” "
"For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day. ","Đó ényí Jozuwée ko kplá togun ɔ́ byɔ́ gbɔjɛtɛn énɛ́ mɛ wɛ ɔ́, Mawu sɔ́ ná lɛ́ wá ɖɔ azǎn ɖěvo xó ǎ. "
"There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God; ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, gbɔjɛ́ ɖé ɖo te nú togun Mawu tɔn, bó cí gbɔjɛ́ e Mawu gbɔjɛ́ azǎn tɛ́nwegɔ́ ɔ́ gbe ɔ́ ɖɔhun. "
"for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his. ","Đó mɛ e byɔ́ fí e Mawu ná ná gbɔjɛ́ ɛ ɖe ɔ́, nɔ gbɔjɛ́ ɖo azɔ̌ é ɖésúnɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ lě e Mawu gbɔjɛ́ azǎn tɛ́nwegɔ́ ɔ́ gbe hwenu e é bló nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ fó gúdo é ɖɔhun. "
"Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience. ","Hǔn, mi bo nú mǐ ná dó gǎn, bó ná byɔ́ gbɔjɛ́ énɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ; mǐ ní bló gbɔn alɔkpa ɖé bónú mǐ mɛ ɖěbǔ ní ma vɛ́ tóli bó gɔn gbɔjɛ́ énɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ byɔ́ lě e mɛ e nɔ gbětótló mɛ lɛ́ɛ vɛ́ tóli gbɔn é ó. "
"For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. ","Đó Mawuxó ɔ́ ɖo gbɛ, bó ɖó hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n; é ɖá hú jǐví nuwenɔ bǐ. É nɔ byɔ́ káká fí e lǐndɔ̌n kpó yɛ kpó kplé ɖe ɔ́, bó nɔ má yě ɖó vovo.

Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account. ,"Nǔ ɖěbǔ tíin bɔ è sixú sɔ́ hwlá dó Mawu ǎ.

"Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess. ","Hǔn, mi bo nú mǐ ná hɛn nǔɖiɖixó e ɖɔ wɛ mǐ ɖe ɔ́ syɛ́nsyɛ́n. Nǔgbó ɔ́, mǐ ɖó vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́gán ɖaxó ɖokpó; Jezu Mawu ví ɔ́ wɛ; é hun káká yi Mawu ɖésú nukɔn. "
"For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are–yet was without sin.

"Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.Every high priest is selected from among men and is appointed to represent them in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. ","Hǔn, mi bo nú mǐ ná sɛkpɔ́ axɔ́súzinkpo Mawu tɔn, fí e fɛ́nú ɖe ɔ́, kpódó jiɖiɖe kpán; é ná sɔ́ hwɛ kɛ mǐ ɖo fínɛ́.

"He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he himself is subject to weakness. ","Ée é ɖésúnɔ lɔ nyí mɛ, bó ma ɖó gǎn ǎ gbɔn alɔkpa gěgé mɛ é ɔ́, é sixú kpɔ́n bó ɖɔ xá mɛ e ma tunwun nǔɖé ǎ lɛ́ɛ, kpó mɛ e nɔ wa nǔ nyi do lɛ́ɛ kpán. "
"This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people. ","Ée é ɖésúnɔ ma ka ɖó gǎn mɔ̌ ǎ é ɔ́, é nyí hwɛ e togun ɔ́ hu lɛ́ɛ kɛ́ɖɛ́ tamɛ wɛ é ná sá vɔ̌ dó ǎ; lo ɔ́, é ɖó ná sá vɔ̌ dó hwɛ e é ɖésúnɔ hu lɛ́ɛ lɔ tamɛ. "
"No one takes this honor upon himself; he must be called by God, just as Aaron was. ","Mɛ ɖěbǔ nɔ na susu e ɖo vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó nyínyí mɛ ɔ́ éɖée ǎ; lo ɔ́, Mawu wɛ nɔ ylɔ́ mɛ lě e é ylɔ́ Aalɔ́ɔn gbɔn é. "
"So Christ also did not take upon himself the glory of becoming a high priest. But God said to him, “You are my Son; today I have become your Father. ” ","Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, Klísu ná susu e ɖo vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó nyínyí mɛ ɔ́ éɖée ǎ; é nyɔ́ wa ɔ́, Mawu wɛ ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Vǐ ce wɛ a nyǐ, bɔ égbé ɔ́, un ji we.” "
"And he says in another place, “You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.” ","É lɛ́ ɖɔ ɖó fí ɖěvo ɖɔ: “A nǎ nyí vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ káká sɔ́yi, Mɛlukisedɛ́ki ɖɔhun.” "
"During the days of Jesus' life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. ","Hwenu e Jezu ɖo gbɛ ɖo ayǐkúngban jí fí ɔ́, é xo ɖɛ bó sa vo kpódó xósúsú kpó, kpódó ɖasin kpó, nú Mawu e kpé wú bó ná hwlɛ́n ɛ ɖo kú sí é. Mawu ka yí ɖɛ tɔn, ɖó é hwíhwɛ́ éɖée dó Mawu glɔ́ wútu.

"Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered ","É kplɔ́n tónúsise gbɔn ya e é ji lɛ́ɛ gbla mɛ, có Mawu ví wɛ é ka nyí. "
"and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him ","Ée Mawu sɔ́ ɛ dó ɖó mɛ mímɛ́ bɔ nǔ bǐ vɔ ɖ'é wú ɔ́, é húzú hwlɛngán mavɔ mavɔ sín jɔtɛn nú mɛ e nɔ se tónú n'i lɛ́ɛ é bǐ, "
and was designated by God to be high priest in the order of Melchizedek. ,bɔ Mawu sɔ́ ɛ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó Mɛlukisedɛ́ki ɖɔhun. 
"We have much to say about this, but it is hard to explain because you are slow to learn. ","Mǐ ɖó nǔ gěgé bó ná ɖɔ nú mi dó xó énɛ́ ɔ́ wú; lo ɔ́, é ná vɛ́ wǔ ɖésú bɔ è nǎ tínmɛ nú mi, ɖó mi wá húzú mɛ e ma nɔ yá wǔ mɔ nukúnnú jɛ nǔ mɛ ǎ é. "
"In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's word all over again. You need milk, not solid food!

"But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death, and of faith in God, ","Lo ɔ́, nǔɖuɖu syɛ́nsyɛ́n ɔ́, mɛxó lɛ́ɛ tɔn wɛ; mɛxó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ kó tunwun nǔ ɖagbe ɖo nǔ nyanya mɛ, gbɔn nǔwiwa yětɔn lɛ́ɛ gbla mɛ, bɔ é ko má yě.Hǔn, mi bo nú mǐ ná yi nukɔn, bó dín zɛ nǔkplɔ́nmɛ nukɔn nukɔntɔn e ɖɔ xó dó Klísu wú lɛ́ɛ wú, bó jɛ nǔ e è nɔ kplɔ́n mɛ e ko su ɖo nǔɖiɖi mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́ kplɔ́n jí.

Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God. ,"Ényí ayǐkúngban e nɔ sɔ́ jǐ e ɖo jija dó jǐ tɔn wɛ hwɛhwɛ ɔ́ sín sin nu, bó nɔ́ ná nǔɖuɖu mɛ e wú è lɛ ɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, Mawu nɔ dó acɛ jǐ tɔn. "
But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed. In the end it will be burned. ,"Amɔ̌, nú ayǐkúngban ɔ́ ka nɔ ná wunkan kpódó gběhan kpó ɔ́, hǔn é nyí ayǐkúngban ɖagbe ǎ; Mawu ná dó nu i sɔ́ ɖo fí ɖé ǎ, bɔ é ná yi vɔ ɖo myɔ mɛ. "
"Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are confident of better things in your case–things that accompany salvation. ","Mɛvívɛ́ná ce lɛ́ɛ mi, nǔ ɖo mɔ̌ có mǐ ná bó ɖo xó ɖɔ gbɔn mɔ̌ wɛ ɔ́, mǐ ɖeji dó mi wú titewungbe; mǐ tunwun ɖɔ mi ɖo ali ɖagbe ɔ́ jí; hwlɛngán sín ali ɔ́ jí wɛ mi ɖe. "
God is not unjust,Fon
"We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, in order to make your hope sure. ","Amɔ̌ mǐ jló ɖɔ ɖokpó ɖokpó mitɔn ní ɖe bǐbí dó nǔ wú énɛ́ xlɛ́ káká sɔ́yi vivɔnu, bónú nǔ e ɖó nukún wɛ mi ɖe ɔ́ ná jɛ. "
"We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised. ","Mǐ jló ɖɔ mi ní húzú fɔnlínnɔ ǎ, lo ɔ́, mi ní xwedó xlɛ́ mɛ e ɖi nǔ bó ɖó sɔxwixwe, bó nɔ mɔ nǔ e sín akpá Mawu dó ɔ́ yí, ɖó énɛ́ wú lɛ́ɛ é tɔn. "
"When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by, he swore by himself, ","Hwenu e Mawu dó akpá nú Ablaxámu ɔ́, é xwlé nǔ n'i d'é jí. Ée mɛɖé ma ka tíin, bó hú gǎn éyɛ́ Mawu ɔ́, bɔ é ná xwlé ǎ ɔ́, é xwlé é ɖésúnɔ n'i. "
"saying, “I will surely bless you and give you many descendants.” ",É ɖɔ: “Un d'akpá nú we ɖɔ: un ná xo ɖɛ dó jǐ towe
"And so after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised. ","Ablaxámu ɖó sɔxwixwe, bó nɔ te kpɔ́n Mawu, bɔ énɛ́ ɔ́, nǔ e sín akpá Mawu dó ɔ́, é mɔ yí. "
"Men swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument. ","Ényí gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖo nǔ ná xwlé wɛ ɔ́, mɛ e hú gǎn yě ɔ́ wɛ yě nɔ xwlé, bɔ nǔ e yě xwlé ɔ́ nɔ nyí gǎnjɛwú, bó nɔ sú nǔ dó nǔdindɔn bǐ ɖo tɛ́ntin yětɔn. "
"Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, he confirmed it with an oath. ","Mɛ e ɖó ná mɔ nǔ ɖagbe e sín akpá Mawu dó lɛ́ɛ yí ɔ́, Mawu jló ná lɛ́ ɖe xlɛ́ yě céɖécéɖé d'é jí ɖɔ émí kún ná húzú gbeta émítɔn gbeɖé ó. Énɛ́ ɔ́ wútu wɛ hwenu e é dó akpá ɔ́, é xwlé nǔ d'é jí. "
"God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope offered to us may be greatly encouraged. ","Hǔn, nǔ we tíin: akpá e é dó ɔ́ kpó nǔ e é xwlé ɔ́ kpó; nǔ we énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, è sixú ɖyɔ́ yě ǎ, bɔ ɖo nǔ we énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɔ́, Mawu sixú ɖó adingban ǎ.

"We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain, ","Nukúnɖíɖó énɛ́ ɔ́ nɔ hɛn lǐndɔ̌n mǐtɔn syɛ́nsyɛ́n, lě e gandótɔnu nɔ hɛn tɔjíhún syɛ́nsyɛ́n ɖó te gbɔn é.

"where Jesus, who went before us, has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.This Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him, ","Fínɛ́ wɛ Jezu jɛ nukɔn nú mǐ, bó yi dó ta mǐtɔn mɛ. É húzú vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó káká sɔ́yi, Mɛlukisedɛ́ki ɖɔhun.Mɛlukisedɛ́ki énɛ́ ɔ́, Salɛ́mu xɔ́sú wɛ é nyí, bó lɛ́ nyí vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ Mawu Ajalɔ̌nlɔn ɔ́ tɔn.

"and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, his name means “king of righteousness”; then also, “king of Salem” means “king of peace.” ","Ablaxámu ná nǔ e é hɛn sín ahwangbénu é bǐ sín mǎɖówǒ Mɛlukisedɛ́ki. Nyǐkɔ Mɛlukisedɛ́ki ɔ́, tínmɛ tɔn nukɔntɔn ɔ́ wɛ nyí “Axɔ́sú hwɛjijɔnɔ”. Gɔ́ nú énɛ́ ɔ́, é nyí axɔ́sú Salɛ́mu tɔn; tínmɛ tɔn wɛ nyí: “Axɔ́sú fífánɔ”. "
"Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God he remains a priest forever. ","Mɛlukisedɛ́ki ɔ́, è tunwun tɔ́ tɔn ǎ, è tunwun nɔ tɔn ǎ; è tunwun tɔ́gbó tɔn ɖěbǔ ǎ; è ka ɖɔ jiji tɔn abǐ kú tɔn xó ɖo fí ɖěbǔ ǎ; é cí Mawu ví ɔ́ ɖɔhun; é nyí vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ káká sɔ́yi. "
Just think how great he was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder! ,Mi kpɔ́n lě e Mɛlukisedɛ́ki ɔ́ nyí nǔɖaxó sɔ é! Tɔ́gbó mǐtɔn Ablaxámu ɖésú ná ɛ mǎɖówǒ nǔ e é hɛn wá sín ahwangbénu ɔ́ tɔn. 
"Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people–that is, their brothers–even though their brothers are descended from Abraham. ","Mɛ e jɔ ɖo Levíi kún mɛ, bó nyí vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, ɖo sɛ́n ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, yě ɖó ná nɔ yí mǎɖówǒ nǔ bǐ tɔn ɖo togun Izlayɛ́li tɔn sí.

"This man, however, did not trace his descent from Levi, yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. ","Mɛlukisedɛ́ki nyí Levíi ví ǎ, có é ka yí mǎɖówǒ ɖo Ablaxámu sí; é lɛ́ dó acɛ mɛ e Mawu dó akpá lɛ́ɛ ná ɔ́ jí. "
And without doubt the lesser person is blessed by the greater. ,Mɛ bǐ tunwun din ɖɔ mɛ e dó acɛ mɛ jí ɔ́ hú gǎn mɛ e jí è dǒ acɛ é
"In the one case, the tenth is collected by men who die; but in the other case, by him who is declared to be living. ","Levíi ví e nɔ yí mǎɖówǒ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, gbɛtɔ́ wɛ yě nyí, bó nɔ kú; lo ɔ́, Mɛlukisedɛ́ki e yí mǎɖówǒ ɔ́, mɛ e Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖe kúnnu ná ɖɔ é ɖo gbɛ ɔ́ wɛ. "
"One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham, ","Nú è nǎ ɖɔ kpowun ɔ́, ée Ablaxámu ná mǎɖówǒ Mɛlukisedɛ́ki ɔ́, Levíi lɔ ná mǎɖówǒ Mɛlukisedɛ́ki gbɔn Ablaxámu jí. "
"because when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the body of his ancestor. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, è ko ji Levíi ǎ; amɔ̌, é ɖo tɔ́gbó tɔn Ablaxámu mɛ, hwenu e Mɛlukisedɛ́ki yi kpé Ablaxámu é. "
"If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the law was given to the people), why was there still need for another priest to come–one in the order of Melchizedek, not in the order of Aaron? ","Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ sín azɔ̌ e Levíi lɛ́ɛ nɔ wa é jí wɛ sɛ́n e è nǎ togun Izlayɛ́li tɔn ɔ́ jínjɔ́n.

"
"For when there is a change of the priesthood, there must also be a change of the law. ","Đó ényí è ɖyɔ̌ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́zɔ́ sín kanfifɔ ɔ́, é ɖo dandan mɛ bɔ è nǎ ɖyɔ́ sɛ́n ɔ́ lɔmɔ̌. "
"He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar. ","Aklúnɔ mǐtɔn e wú è ɖɔ xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ dó ɔ́, kún ɖěvo mɛ wɛ é jɔ ɖe, bɔ mɛ ɖěbǔ ɖo kún énɛ́ mɛ, bó wa vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ sín azɔ̌ ɖo vɔ̌sákpe jí kpɔ́n gbeɖé ǎ. "
"For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests. ","È tunwun ganjí ɖɔ Judáa kún mɛ wɛ é jɔ ɖe, bɔ Mɔyízi ka ɖɔ xó ɖěbǔ dó kún énɛ́ wú hwenu e é ɖɔ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ lɛ́ɛ sín xó é ǎ. "
"And what we have said is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears, ",Nǔ e jɛ bó lɛ́ ɖe nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ xlɛ́ céɖécéɖé d'é jí ɔ́ ɖíe: vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ Mɛlukisedɛ́ki ɖɔhun ɖěvo wá. 
one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life. ,Sɛ́n gbɛtɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖě wɛ è xwedó bó sɔ́ ɛ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ǎ
"For it is declared: “You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.” ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ: “A nǎ nyí vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ káká sɔ́yi Mɛlukisedɛ́ki ɖɔhun.” "
The former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless ,"Ée nǔ nyí mɔ̌ ɔ́, é gbídí sɛ́n xóxó ɔ́, ɖó sɛ́n énɛ́ ɖó gǎn ɖé ǎ, é ka nyí nǔɖé wa nú ǎ. "
"(for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, Mɔyízisɛ́n ɔ́ bló bɔ nǔɖé nyɔ́ káká yi fó ǎ; nukúnɖíɖó ɖagbe ɖé ka wá bó nyɔ́ hú mɔ̌; nukúnɖíɖó énɛ́ wɛ bló bɔ mǐ nɔ sɛkpɔ́ Mawu. "
"And it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any oath, ",Ée lɛ́ hú gǎn mɔ̌ ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ Mawu xwlé nǔ d'é jí. É ka xwlé nǔɖé dó Levíi lɛ́ɛ jí hwenu e yě húzú vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ é ǎ. 
but he became a priest with an oath when God said to him: “The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: ‘You are a priest forever.’ ” ,"Lo ɔ́, Mawu sɔ́ Jezu vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́, bó xwlé nǔ d'é jí hwenu e é ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ xwlé nǔ bó ɖɔ: ‘A nǎ nyí vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ káká sɔ́yi.’ ” É ka ná húzú gbe ǎ. "
"Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, Jezu lɔ nyí akɔjijɛ e nyɔ́ hú akɔjijɛ nukɔntɔn ɔ́ sín gǎnjɛwú nú mǐ. "
"Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office; ","Vogbingbɔn ɖěvo lɛ́ tíin: vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ e jɔ ɖo Levíi kún mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, yě sukpɔ́; amɔ̌ yě nɔ ɖo kúkú wɛ, bɔ azɔ̌ yětɔn sɔ́ nɔ sixú yi nukɔn ǎ. "
"but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood. ","Lo ɔ́, Jezu ɔ́ ɖo gbɛ tɛgbɛ, bɔ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ sín azɔ̌ tɔn ɔ́, é ná ɖo wiwa wɛ káká sɔ́yi. "
"Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. ","Énɛ́ wú wɛ é hɛn ɔ́, é ná hwlɛ́n mɛ e gbɔn jǐ tɔn bó sɛkpɔ́ Mawu lɛ́ɛ é bǐ gǎn, bɔ nǔ bǐ ná vɔ ɖ'é wú sín din káká sɔ́yi, ɖó é ɖo gbɛ tɛgbɛ, bó ná nɔ sa vo nú Mawu dó ta yětɔn mɛ. "
"Such a high priest meets our need–one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens. ","Hǔn, Jezu wɛ nyí vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó e jɛ xá mǐ é, ɖó é nyí mɛ mímɛ́; é wa nǔ nyanya ɖěbǔ ǎ; hwɛ ɖěbǔ ɖo kɔ n'i ǎ. È sɔ́ ɛ ɖó vo nú hwɛhutɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, bó sɔ́ ɛ dó jǐ aga ɖo sɛ́xwé. "
"Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself. ","É cí vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó ɖě lɛ́ɛ ɖɔhun ǎ: yědɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, ayǐhɔ́ngbe ayǐhɔ́ngbe ɔ́, yě nɔ to sá vɔ̌ dó hwɛ e yě ɖésúnɔ hu lɛ́ɛ tamɛ hwɛ̌, có bó nɔ́ wá sá vɔ̌ dó hwɛ e togun ɔ́ hu lɛ́ɛ tamɛ; Jezu ka bló gbɔn mɔ̌ ǎ. Azɔn ɖokpó géé wɛ é sá vɔ̌ hwenu e é sɔ́ éɖée jó é, bɔ xó fó. "
"For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever.The point of what we are saying is this: We do have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, ","Mɔyízisɛ́n ɔ́, gbɛtɔ́ wɛ é nɔ sɔ́ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó; gbɛtɔ́ ka ɖó gǎn ɖé ǎ; lo ɔ́, xó e Mawu ɖɔ bó xwlé nǔ d'é jí ɖo sɛ́n ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, Mawu ví ɔ́ wɛ é sɔ́ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó; é ɖó blɔ̌ ǎ káká sɔ́yi.Nǔ e ɖo tají hú ɖě lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɖo nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ mǐ ɖe ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́ ɖíe: Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó mɔ̌hun wɛ mǐ ɖó, bɔ é jínjɔ́n ɖisíxwé nú axɔ́súzinkpo Mawu susu bǐ nɔ ɔ́ tɔn ɖo sɛ́xwé.

"and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by man. ","É ɖo vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó sín azɔ̌ wa wɛ ɖo Tɛn mímɛ́ bǐ ɔ́ mɛ; Tɛn mímɛ́ bǐ e nyí goxɔ titewungbe e gbɛtɔ́ ma gbá ǎ, bɔ Aklúnɔ gbá é. "
"Every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, and so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer. ","Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó ɖěbǔ ɔ́, è nɔ sɔ́ ɛ nú é ná xwlé nǔníná kpó vɔ̌sánú kpó Mawu. Hǔn é ɖo dandan mɛ ɖɔ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó mǐ lɔ tɔn ní ɖó nǔɖé bó ná xwlé Mawu. "
"If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, for there are already men who offer the gifts prescribed by the law. ","Nú ayǐkúngban jí wɛ é ko ɖe ɔ́, é tlɛ ná nyí vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ǎ, ɖó vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖe, bó nɔ xwlé nǔníná lɛ́ɛ Mawu, lě e Jwifu lɛ́ɛ sín sɛ́n zɔ́n gbɔn é. "
They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.” ,"Azɔ̌ e wa wɛ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖe ɔ́ nyí xlɛ̌, bó nyí yɛ nǔ e ɖo sɛ́xwé ɔ́ tɔn.

"But the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one, and it is founded on better promises. ","Amɔ̌ din ɔ́, azɔ̌ e è zɔ̌n Jezu ɔ́ hú gǎn yětɔn tawun, ɖó é wɛ nyí ɖɛ̌mɛnu nú akɔ e Mawu jɛ xá togun tɔn bɔ é nyɔ́ hú nukɔntɔn é; ɖó akɔjijɛ énɛ́ ɔ́ jínjɔ́n akpá e Mawu dó bɔ é nyɔ́ hú ɖě lɛ́ɛ bǐ lɛ́ɛ é jí. "
"For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another. ","Ényí akɔjijɛ nukɔntɔn ɔ́ ma ko ɖó blɔ̌ ǎ ɔ́, é sɔ́ ná byɔ́ ɖɔ è nǎ sɔ́ akɔjijɛ wegɔ́ ɔ́ dó ɖyɔ́ ná ǎ. "
"But God found fault with the people and said: “The time is coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah. ","Lo ɔ́, Mawu mɔ nǔjɛdo ɖo togun tɔn wú, bó ná kɛ nu d'é wú hwenu e é ɖɔ ɖo Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ɖɔ: “Azǎn ɖé lɛ́ɛ ná wá, bɔ un ná jɛ akɔ yɔ̌yɔ́ ɖé xá Izlayɛ́li kpódó Judáa kpó sín togun. "
"It will not be like the covenant I made with their forefathers when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they did not remain faithful to my covenant, and I turned away from them, declares the Lord. ","É ná cí akɔ e un jɛ xá tɔ́gbó yětɔn lɛ́ɛ, gbe e gbe un hɛn alɔ yětɔn, bó kplá yě tɔ́n sín Ejípu é ɖɔhun ǎ; yě nɔ gbejí nú akɔjijɛ énɛ́ ɔ́ ǎ. Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, un sɔ́ flín yě ǎ. "
"This is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after that time, declares the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. ","Azǎn énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ gúdo ɔ́, nǔ e sín akɔ un ná jɛ xá Izlayɛ́li ví lɛ́ɛ é ɖíe: Un ná bló bɔ sɛ́n ce lɛ́ɛ ná nɔ ta yětɔn mɛ; un ná wlán yě dó ayi yětɔn mɛ; un ná nyí Mawu yětɔn, bɔ yě ná nyí togun ce. "
"No longer will a man teach his neighbor, or a man his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest.

For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.” ,Un ná sɔ́ nǔ e yě wa nyi do lɛ́ɛ kɛ yě
"By calling this covenant “new,” he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear.Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary. ","Ée Mawu ɖɔ akɔjijɛ yɔ̌yɔ́ ɔ́ xó ɔ́, é bló bɔ akɔ nukɔntɔn ɔ́ húzú nǔ xóxó; nǔ e ka húzú nǔ xóxó, bó lɛ́ fɔ́n bó ɖo xó dó d'é jí wɛ ɔ́ kó ɖo nǎ bú wɛ.Akɔjijɛ nukɔntɔn ɔ́ ko ɖó tito lɛ́ɛ nú Mawu sinsɛn, bó ɖó sinsɛnxɔ e gbɛtɔ́ sɔ́ alɔ dó gbá é ɖokpó. "
"A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand, the table and the consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place. ","È gbǎ goxɔ ɖokpó bɔ è nɔ ylɔ́ tɛn nukɔntɔn e ɖo goxɔ ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́ ɖɔ Tɛn mímɛ́. Fí énɛ́ ɔ́ wɛ è fɔ zogbɛ́nhɛnnú kpó távo kpó, kpódó wɔ̌xúxú e è xwlé Mawu lɛ́ɛ kpán ɖó. "
"Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place, ","Tɛn wegɔ́ e ɖo xɔmɛgbovɔ wegɔ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Tɛn mímɛ́ bǐ. "
"which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron's staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant. ","Vɔ̌sákpe e è blǒ kpó siká kpó bɔ è nɔ dó zǎlínkpɔ́n zo ɖ'é jí ɔ́ ɖo fínɛ́, bɔ akɔjijɛgbá e wú è kɔn siká dó gbɔn fí bǐ ɔ́ ɖo fínɛ́.

"Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now. ","Wɛnsagun susunɔ e ɖe xlɛ́ ɖɔ Mawu ɖo tɛn énɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖo akɔjijɛgbá ɔ́ ta, bó kɛ awa yětɔn lɛ́ɛ cyɔ́n fí e è nɔ sá vɔ̌ ɖe, bó nɔ́ mɔ hwɛsɔ́kɛ yí ɖe é. Amɔ̌, hwenu e è nǎ tín nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó mɛ dó ɔ́ ɖíe ǎ. "
"When everything had been arranged like this, the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry. ","È to nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ gbɔn mɔ̌, bɔ vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ lɛ́ɛ nɔ byɔ́ tɛn nukɔntɔn ɔ́ mɛ ayǐhɔ́ngbe ayǐhɔ́ngbe, bó nɔ wa azɔ̌ yětɔn. "
"But only the high priest entered the inner room, and that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance. ","Amɔ̌, tɛn wegɔ́ ɔ́, vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó ɔ́ kɛ́ɖɛ́ jɛ́n nɔ byɔ́ mɛ; azɔn ɖokpó wɛ é nɔ byɔ́ mɛ ɖo xwe ɖokpó mɛ.

The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still standing. ,"Yɛsinsɛn ɔ́ ɖo ɖiɖe xlɛ́ wɛ gbɔn fínɛ́ ɖɔ ényí tɛn nukɔntɔn ɔ́ kpo ɖo te jɛ́n wɛ ɔ́, ali e yi Tɛn mímɛ́ bǐ ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, è kún ko hun ó. "
"This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper. ","Nǔ énɛ́ ɔ́, xlɛ́ ɖé wɛ é nyí, bó ɖo xó ɖɔ dó hwenu e mǐ ɖe din ɔ́ wú wɛ.

They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings–external regulations applying until the time of the new order. ,"Đó Mawu sinsɛn gbɔn mɔ̌ ɔ́, nǔɖuɖu kpó ahan nunu kpó, kpódó wǔsláslá sín nǔwiwa tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ lɛ́ɛ kpó sín sɛ́n kpowun wɛ; tito gbɛtɔ́ tɔn kpowun wɛ, bó wa azɔ̌ káká jɛ hwenu e Mawu vɔ́ nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ to dó é. "
"When Christ came as high priest of the good things that are already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not man-made, that is to say, not a part of this creation. ","Lo ɔ́, Klísu ɔ́ wá, bó nyí vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó nú nǔ ɖagbe e wá lɛ́ɛ, bɔ goxɔ e mɛ é nɔ wa azɔ̌ tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖe ɔ́ ɖo tají bó sɔgbe, bɔ nǔ bǐ vɔ ɖ'é wú hú ée gbɛtɔ́ gbá ɔ́; é nyí gbɛmɛ fí sín nǔ ǎ. "
"He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption. ",Azɔn ɖokpó géé jɛ́n Klísu byɔ́ Tɛn mímɛ́ bǐ ɔ́ mɛ bɔ xó fó
The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean. ,"Mɛ e ɖu su lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, gbǎgbá sín hun kpó nyibúsú sín hun kpó wɛ è nɔ dó slá wǔ nú agbaza yětɔn; nyibú asi wínnyáwínnyá wɛ è nɔ dó zo, bó nɔ́ fúnfún afín tɔn yě jǐ, bó nɔ́ dó slá wǔ nú agbaza yětɔn. "
"How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God! ","Ée nǔ nyí mɔ̌ ɔ́, nɛ̌ Klísu sín hun ma ná wa azɔ̌ hú mɔ̌ ǎ gbɔn? Ɖó Klísu ɔ́ sɔ́ éɖée dó sá vɔ̌ nú Mawu vɔ̌sánú maɖóblɔ̌ ɖɔhun gbɔn Yɛ mavɔ mavɔ jí; hun tɔn ná slá wǔ nú ayixa mǐtɔn, bó ná ɖe azɔ̌ e nyí azɔ̌ nyanya ɖ'é mɛ lɛ́ɛ sín mɛ, bónú mǐ ná sixú wa azɔ̌ nú Mawu gbɛɖe ɔ́. "
"For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance–now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ Klísu nyí ɖɛ̌mɛnu nú akɔjijɛ yɔ̌yɔ́ ɔ́ bónú mɛ e Mawu ylɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ná sixú mɔ nyɔ̌ná mavɔ mavɔ e sín akpá é dó nú yě lɛ́ɛ yí.

"In the case of a will, it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it, ","Ényí wěma e ɖɔ mɛ e ná ɖu mɛɖé sín gǔ ɔ́ tíin ɔ́, é ɖo dandan mɛ bɔ è nǎ ɖe xlɛ́ ɖɔ mɛ e wlán wěma ɔ́ ko kú. "
because a will is in force only when somebody has died,Fon
This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood. ,Énɛ́ wútu wɛ hun to kɔn nyi ayǐ hwɛ̌ cóbɔ akɔjijɛ nukɔntɔn ɔ́ ɖésú bɛ́ azɔ̌. 
"When Moses had proclaimed every commandment of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves, together with water, scarlet wool and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people. ","Nǔ nukɔntɔn e Mɔyízi bló ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ: é xa nǔ e sɛ́n ɔ́ zɔ́n ɖɔ è ní wa lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɖo togun ɔ́ bǐ nukɔn lě e è wlǎn gbɔn dó sɛ́nwéma ɔ́ mɛ é.

"
"He said, “This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep.” ","É ɖɔ: “Akɔjijɛ e Mawu ɖɔ nú mi ɖɔ mi ní nɔ gbejí ná ɔ́, sin hun wɛ nyí élɔ́.” "
"In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies. ","Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, Mɔyízi mì hun dó goxɔ ɔ́ wú, bó mì dó nǔ e è nɔ dó wa sinsɛnzɔ́ ná lɛ́ɛ bǐ wú. "
"In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, ɖo sɛ́n ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́, nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ è nɔ ɖibla slá wǔ ná kpódó hun kpó, bɔ cóbónú Mawu ná sɔ́ hwɛ kɛ mɛɖé ɔ́, hun jɛ́n nɔ́ kɔn nyi ayǐ. "
"It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. ","Nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ e nyí xlɛ́ nǔ e ɖo sɛ́xwé lɛ́ɛ tɔn ɔ́, lě e è ɖǒ ná nɔ slá wǔ nú yě gbɔn é nɛ́. Amɔ̌, nǔ e ɖo sɛ́xwé lɛ́ɛ ɖésú ɔ́, vɔ̌ e è nǎ sá dó slá wǔ nú yědɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́ ná nyɔ́ hú mɔ̌ titewungbe. "
"For Christ did not enter a man-made sanctuary that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God's presence. ","Đó Tɛn mímɛ́ e mɛ Klísu byɔ́ ɔ́ nyí Tɛn mímɛ́ ɖé kpowun bɔ gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bló, bɔ é nyí xlɛ́ Tɛn mímɛ́ titewungbe ɔ́ tɔn ǎ; lo ɔ́, sɛ́xwé ɖésú wɛ é yi. Fínɛ́ wɛ é ɖo Mawu nukɔn ɖe din, dó ta mǐtɔn mɛ. "
"Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own. ","Jwifu lɛ́ɛ sín vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖaxó ɔ́ nɔ hɛn kanlin e è dǒ sá vɔ̌ ná nú Mawu ɔ́ sín hun, bó nɔ byɔ́ Tɛn mímɛ́ bǐ ɔ́ mɛ xwewú xwewú; Klísu ɔ́ ka byɔ́ mɛ, bó ná sɔ́ éɖée dó sá vɔ̌ ná azɔn gěgé ǎ. "
Then Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But now he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself. ,"Ényí mɔ̌ wɛ é nyí ɔ́, é ɖó ná ko ji ya azɔn mɔ̌kpán sín hwenu e Mawu ɖó gbɛ ɔ́ dó é; nǔgbó ɔ́, azɔn ɖokpó géé jɛ́n é wá, bɔ xó fó, hwenu e nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ sín fífó ko sɛ yá é, bó sɔ́ éɖée dó sá vɔ̌ ná, bó ná dó ɖe hwɛhuhu síin. "
"Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment, ","Gbɛtɔ́ ɖěbǔ ɔ́, azɔn ɖokpó géé wɛ é ɖó ná kú, bɔ énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, Mawu ná ɖɔ hwɛ xá ɛ. "
"so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming–not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship. ","Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, Klísu sɔ́ éɖée dó sá vɔ̌ ná azɔn ɖokpó géé énɛ́ ɔ́ dó hwɛ gbɛtɔ́ gěgé tɔn tamɛ. É ná wá azɔn wegɔ́ ɔ́, é ka sɔ́ ná nyí hwɛhuhu wɛ é ná wá ɖe síin ǎ; lo ɔ́, mɛ e ɖo te kpɔ́n ɛ ɖɔ é ní wá hwlɛ́n émí gán lɛ́ɛ wɛ é ná wá hwlɛ́n gán.Sɛ́n Jwifu lɛ́ɛ tɔn nyí nǔ ɖagbe e jǎwe lɛ́ɛ sín ninɔmɛ pɛ́pɛ́pɛ́ ǎ; yɛ nǔ lɛ́ɛ tɔn kpowun wɛ.

"
"If it could, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins. ","Mɛ e nɔ sɛn Mawu gbɔn mɔ̌ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, ényí è ko slá wǔ titewungbe ɔ́ nú yě azɔn ɖokpó bɔ xó fó wɛ ɔ́, yě sɔ́ ná lɛ́ kpo ɖo linlin wɛ ɖɔ hwɛ émítɔn lɛ́ɛ kpo ɖo kɔ nú émí ǎ, bó ná jó vɔ̌sísá tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ bǐ dó.

"But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins, ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, hwɛ e mɛ lɛ́ɛ hu ɔ́ wɛ vɔ̌sísá énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ nɔ flín yě xwewú xwewú. "
because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. ,Đó nyibúsú sín hun kpó gbǎgbá sín hun kpó sixú súnsún hwɛ mɛtɔn lɛ́ɛ gbeɖé ǎ. 
"Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said: “Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me; ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú wɛ hwenu e Klísu ɖo gbɛ ɔ́ mɛ ná byɔ́ wɛ ɔ́, é ɖɔ nú Mawu ɖɔ: “A ba vɔ̌sísá ǎ, a ka ba nǔníná ǎ; lo ɔ́, a nǎ agbaza ɖokpó mì. "
with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased. ,Kanlin e dó zo wɛ è nɔ ɖe ɖo vɔ̌sákpe jí lɛ́ɛ nɔ dó xomɛhunhun nú we ǎ
"Then I said, ‘Here I am–it is written about me in the scroll– I have come to do your will, O God.’ ” ","Bɔ un ɖɔ: ‘Mawu e, nyɛ ɖíe, un ja bó ná wa jlǒ towe lě e è ko wlán gbɔn dó wǔ ce, ɖo sɛ́nwéma ɔ́ mɛ é.’ ” "
"First he said, “Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them” (although the law required them to be made). ",É tó ɖɔ: “A ba vɔ̌sísá ǎ
"Then he said, “Here I am, I have come to do your will.” He sets aside the first to establish the second. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, é lɛ́ ɖɔ: “Mawu e, nyɛ ɖíe, un ja, bó ná wa jlǒ towe.” Énɛ́ ɔ́, é ɖe vɔ̌sísá xóxó lɛ́ɛ bǐ síin, bó ɖó yɔ̌yɔ́ ɔ́ ayǐ. "
"And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. ","Đó Jezu Klísu bló nǔ e Mawu jló ɖɔ ní bló é wú ɔ́, è slá wǔ nú mǐ gbɔn agbaza é ɖésúnɔ tɔn e é sɔ́ dó sá vɔ̌ ná azɔn ɖokpó bɔ xó fó ɔ́ gbla mɛ. "
"Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. ","Vɔ̌sánú-xwlémawutɔ́ ɖé fɔ́n ɔ́, é nɔ ɖo azɔ̌ tɔn wa wɛ; é nɔ ɖo vɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́ sá wɛ hwɛhwɛ, có vɔ̌sísá énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ nɔ sixú súnsún hwɛ mɛtɔn lɛ́ɛ síin gbeɖé ǎ. "
"But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God. ","Klísu éyɛ́ ɔ́, vɔ̌ ɖokpó géé wɛ é ka sá dó hwɛ lɛ́ɛ tamɛ, bó yi jínjɔ́n ɖisíxwé nú Mawu, bɔ vɔ̌ énɛ́ e é sá ɔ́ ná ɖo azɔ̌ wa wɛ káká sɔ́yi. "
"Since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool, ","Fínɛ́ wɛ é ɖe din, bó ɖo te nú Mawu ná sɔ́ kɛntɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ dó bló afɔɖótɛn tɔn. "
because by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy. ,"Đó, gbɔn vɔ̌ ɖokpó géé e Klísu sá ɔ́ gblá mɛ ɔ́, é bló bɔ mɛ e è slá wǔ ná lɛ́ɛ húzú mɛɖeɖóvo, bɔ nǔ bǐ vɔ ɖ'é wú káká sɔ́yi. "
The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says: ,"Bɔ Yɛsinsɛn lɔ ɖe kúnnu tɔn nú mǐ. Nǔgbó ɔ́, é to ɖɔ hwɛ̌ ɖɔ: "
"“This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds.” ",“Aklúnɔ ɖɔ: ‘Akɔ e ná jɛ xá yě wɛ un ɖe ɖo azǎn énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ gúdo ɔ́ ɖíe: un ná sɔ́ sɛ́n ce lɛ́ɛ dó ayi mɛ nú yě
Then he adds: “Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.” ,É lɛ́ ɖɔ: “Un sɔ́ ná flín hwɛ e yě hu lɛ́ɛ ǎ
"And where these have been forgiven, there is no longer any sacrifice for sin. ","Hǔn, nú è sɔ́ hwɛ kɛ mɛ ɔ́, é sɔ́ byɔ́ ɖɔ è nǐ sá vɔ̌, bó dó mɔ hwɛsɔ́kɛ yí ǎ. "
"Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, ","Énɛ́ hǔn nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, mǐ ɖó jiɖiɖe kpíkpé ɖɔ mǐ ná yi Tɛn mímɛ́ bǐ ɔ́ mɛ gbɔn hun Jezu tɔn gbla mɛ. "

That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord,Fon

The brother in humble circumstances ought to take pride in his high position. ,"Nɔví e nyí wamamɔnɔ ɔ́ ní tɛ afɔ ayǐ, ɖó Mawu ɖo sísɔ́ ɛ su wɛ; "
"But the one who is rich should take pride in his low position, because he will pass away like a wild flower. ","nɔví e nyí dɔkunnɔ ɔ́ ní tɛ afɔ ayǐ ɖó Mawu ɖo sísɔ́ ɛ hwe wɛ. Nǔgbó ɔ́, dɔkunnɔ ɔ́ sín gbɛ ná wá yi gběhan sɛ́ ɖɔhun. "
"For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich man will fade away even while he goes about his business. ","Hwe nɔ tɔ́n kpó zozo ɖaxó ɖé kpó, bó nɔ fyɔ́ gběhan ɔ́, bɔ sɛ́ ɔ́ nɔ jɛ ayǐ, bɔ ɖɛkpɛ tɔn nɔ bú. Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, dɔkunnɔ ɔ́ ná jɛ ayǐ ɖo nǔ e é nɔ wa lɛ́ɛ mɛ. "
"Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.

"When tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; ","Hwenu e mɛɖé ná jɛ tɛ́nkpɔ́n mɛ ɔ́, ní ma ɖɔ Mawu wɛ ɖo émí tɛ́nkpɔ́n wɛ ó. Đó nǔ nyanya sixú tɛ́n Mawu kpɔ́n ǎ; Mawu ɖésú ka nɔ tɛ́n mɛ ɖěbǔ kpɔ́n ǎ. "

"Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, jlǒ nyanya ɔ́ nɔ ji hwɛhuhu, bɔ hwɛhuhu ɔ́ wá dó ɖɔ do bǐ ɔ́, é nɔ ji kú. "
"Don't be deceived, my dear brothers. ","Nɔví ce vívɛ́ná lɛ́ɛ mi, è ma blɛ́ mi ó. "
"Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.

for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires. ,ɖó mɛ e sin xomɛ ɔ́ nɔ wa nǔ e sɔgbe ɖo Mawu nukún mɛ é ǎ. 
"Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you.

Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror ,"Đó mɛ e nɔ se Mawuxó ɔ́, bó ma nɔ zé dó wa azɔ̌ ná ǎ ɔ́ cí mɛ e ɖo nǔkpɛ́n mɛ kpɔ́n wɛ, bó mɔ lě e é ɖésúnɔ ɖe gbɔn é ɖɔhun. "
"and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. ","Ée é kpɔ́n éɖée gúdo ɔ́, é ɖidó, bó wɔn lě e é ɖe gbɔn ɔ́ tlóló. "
"But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it–he will be blessed in what he does.

"Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don't show favoritism.

Are they not the ones who are slandering the noble name of him to whom you belong? ,Yě wɛ nɔ nylá nu dó nyǐkɔ ɖagbe ɖagbe énɛ́ e Mawu ná mǐ ɔ́ wú ǎ cé? 
"If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, nú mi nɔ nyi axɔ́súɖuto Mawu tɔn sín sɛ́n ɔ́ lě e Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ gbɔn ɔ́, nǔ ɖagbe wa wɛ mi ɖe; é wɛ nyí ɖɔ: “Yǐ wǎn nú nɔzo towe hwi ɖésúnɔ ɖɔhun”. "
"But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. ","Amɔ̌, nú mi nɔ ɖe mɛ ɖě ɖó vo nú mɛ ɖě hǔn, hwɛ hu wɛ mi ɖe, bɔ sɛ́n ɔ́ ɖo hwɛ ɖó nú mi wɛ, ɖó tóli vɛ́ nú sɛ́n ɔ́ wɛ mi ɖe. "
For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it. ,"Đó nú mɛɖé vɛ́ tóli nú nǔ e sɛ́n ɔ́ zɔ́n lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó géé ɔ́, nǔ e sɛ́n ɔ́ zɔ́n lɛ́ɛ bǐ wɛ é vɛ́ tóli ná. "
"For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, mɛ e ɖɔ: “Ma lɛ aga ó” ɔ́, é ɖokpó ɔ́ wɛ lɛ́ ɖɔ: “Ma hu mɛ ó.” Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, ényí a na bo ma lɛ aga ǎ, bó ka hu mɛ ɔ́, sɛ́n wɛ a gba. "
"Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom, ","Mi nɔ ɖɔ xó, bó nɔ wa nǔ mɛ e è ɖǒ ná zé sɛ́n e nɔ ɖe mɛ sín mɛ kannu ɔ́ dó ɖɔ hwɛ xá é ɖɔhun. "
because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment! ,"Đó mɛ e ma kú nǔbláwǔ nú mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ ǎ ɔ́, Mawu ná kú nǔbláwǔ n'i hwenu e è nǎ ɖɔ hwɛ xá ɛ ɔ́ ǎ; lo ɔ́, nǔbláwǔkúnúmɛ ná ɖu ɖo hwɛɖiɖɔ jí. "
"What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him? ","Nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, ényí mɛɖé ɖɔ: “Un ɖó nǔɖiɖi” bó ma nɔ ɖe xlɛ́ ɖo nǔwiwa tɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ ǎ ɔ́, aniwanú wɛ nǔɖiɖi énɛ́ ká nyí? Nǔɖiɖi énɛ́ sixú hwlɛ́n ɛ gán a? "
Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. ,"È nǐ ɖɔ avɔ abǐ nǔɖuɖu hwedó nɔví súnnu abǐ nɔví nyɔ̌nu ɖé, "
"If one of you says to him, “Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed,” but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? ","nú mi ma ná nǔ e ɖo tají bɔ yě ná nɔ gbɛ ɔ́ yě ǎ, lobo ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi ná yi ɖo fífá mɛ; mi dó awu ganjí, bó ɖu nǔ ní kpé mi” ɔ́, ani wɛ é ná wa nú yě? "
"In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead. ","Lě e é ɖe gbɔn nú nǔɖiɖi ɔ́ nɛ́: ényí é ma nɔ ɖe éɖée xlɛ́ gbɔn nǔwiwa lɛ́ɛ mɛ ǎ ɔ́, nǔɖiɖi kúkú wɛ é nyí ɖo éɖée mɛ. "
"But someone will say, “You have faith; I have deeds.” Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do. ","Amɔ̌, nú mɛɖé ɖɔ: “A ɖǒ nǔɖiɖi, bɔ nyɛ ɖó nǔwiwa lɛ́ɛ” ɔ́, nyɛ ná ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Xlɛ́ lě e nǔɖiɖi towe sixú tíin nǔwiwa lɛ́ɛ mɛ vo gbɔn é mi; énɛ́ ɔ́, nyɛ ná xlɛ́ nǔɖiɖi ce we gbɔn nǔwiwa ce lɛ́ɛ mɛ.” "
You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that–and shudder. ,"A ɖi nǔ ɖɔ Mawu ɖokpó géé wɛ ɖe; é nyɔ́ ganjí! Yɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ lɔ ɖi nǔ ɖɔ Mawu ɖokpó géé wɛ ɖe, bɔ xɛsi nɔ ɖi yě, bɔ yě nɔ sísɔ́. "
"You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless ? ",Ayixamasɔgbenánɔ! A jlǒ ɖɔ è nǐ ɖe lě e nǔɖiɖi e ma nɔ wa nǔ ǎ ɔ́ nyí nǔ yǎyá gbɔn ɔ́ xlɛ́ we a? 
Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? ,"Tɔ́gbó mǐtɔn Ablaxámu ɔ́, nɛ̌ Mawu ka mɔ ɛ dó mɔ hwɛjijɔnɔ ná gbɔn? Mawu mɔ ɛ dó mɔ hwɛjijɔnɔ ná ɖó nǔwiwa tɔn lɛ́ɛ wú; ɖó é sɔ́ vǐ tɔn Izáki xwlé Mawu ɖo vɔ̌sákpe jí. "
"You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did. ","A mɔ a? Nǔɖiɖi tɔn kpó nǔwiwa tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó wa azɔ̌ ɖó kpɔ́, bɔ nǔɖiɖi tɔn húzú nǔɖiɖi titewungbe, ɖó nǔɖiɖi tɔn kpó nǔwiwa tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó nɔ wa azɔ̌ ɖó kpɔ́. "
"And the scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,” and he was called God's friend. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, nǔ e è wlǎn dó Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́ jɛ; é wɛ nyí ɖɔ: “Ablaxámu ɖi nǔ nú Mawu, bɔ Mawu kpɔ́n dó nǔɖiɖi tɔn wú, bó mɔ ɛ dó mɔ hwɛjijɔnɔ ná.” Énɛ́ ɔ́, è nɔ ylɔ́ ɛ ɖɔ Mawu xɔ́ntɔn. "
You see that a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone. ,Mi mɔ din ɖɔ Mawu nɔ sɔ́ gbɛtɔ́ dó mɔ hwɛjijɔnɔ ná ɖó nǔwiwa tɔn lɛ́ɛ wú
"In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction? ","Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́ wɛ é nyí nú Hlaxábu agalɛtɔ́ ɔ́. Mawu sɔ́ ɛ dó mɔ hwɛjijɔnɔ ná ɖó nǔwiwa tɔn lɛ́ɛ wú; é wɛ yí dobanúnǔtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ dó xwé gbe, lobo dó alɔ yě, bɔ yě gbɔn ali ɖěvo bo yi. "
"As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.Not many of you should presume to be teachers, my brothers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, lě e agbaza e mɛ lǐndɔ̌n ma ɖe ǎ ɔ́ nyí nǔkúkú gbɔn ɔ́, mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́ wɛ nǔɖiɖi e ma nɔ ɖe éɖée xlɛ́ gbɔn nǔwiwa lɛ́ɛ mɛ ǎ ɔ́ nyí nǔkúkú gbɔn.Nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, mi mɛ gěgé ní ma ba ná nyí nǔkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ ó; ɖó mi tunwun ɖɔ mǐ mɛ nǔkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, Mawu na ɖɔ hwɛ xá mǐ, bɔ é ná syɛ́n hú mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ tɔn ɖésú.

"We all stumble in many ways. If anyone is never at fault in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to keep his whole body in check. ","Mǐ mɛ bǐ wɛ nɔ wa nǔ nyi do gbɔn alɔkpa gěgé mɛ.

"When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal. ","Mǐ nɔ dó gan nu nú sɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, bónú yě na sixú se tónú nú mǐ; énɛ́ ɔ́, mǐ ná dɔn yě yi fí e jló mǐ é. "
"Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go. ","Abǐ mi kpɔ́n nǔ dó tɔjíhún lɛ́ɛ wú; yě d'agba sɔ mɔ̌, bɔ jɔhɔn ɖaxó nɔ ɖo yě sísɛ́ wɛ có, nǔ e è nɔ dó jlɔ́ ali nú yě ɔ́, nǔ kpɛví títí ɖé wɛ, bɔ tɔjíhúnkuntɔ́ ɔ́ nɔ dó jlɔ́ ali nú yě ɖidó fí e jló e é.

"Likewise the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark. ","Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, ɖɛ̌ ɔ́, agbaza sín wǔjɔnú kpɛví ɖé wɛ é nyí; lo ɔ́, é hɛn ɔ́, é ná zé nǔ ɖaxó ɖaxó dó jlá ajɔ̌ nú éɖée. Mi kpɔ́n lě e myɔ kpɛví títí ɖé ko kpé bó ná dó zunkan ɖaxó zo gbɔn é! "
"The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell. ","Đɛ̌ lɔmɔ̌ ɔ́, myɔ wɛ é nyí.

"All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and creatures of the sea are being tamed and have been tamed by man, ","Gbɛtɔ́ hɛn ɔ́, é ná dé gběkanlin alɔkpa alɔkpa lɛ́ɛ, xɛ alɔkpa alɔkpa lɛ́ɛ, kanlin alɔkpa alɔkpa e è nɔ sá lɛ́ɛ, kpó hweví alɔkpa alɔkpa lɛ́ɛ kpó, lobo ka dé yě nǔgbó. "
"but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. ","Lo ɔ́, gbɛtɔ́ ɖěbǔ kpé wú, bó dé ɖɛ̌ tɔn gbeɖé ǎ; nǔ nyanya wɛ é nyí bó ɖo azɔ̌ wa wɛ hwebǐnu; aɖǐ e nɔ hu mɛ ɔ́ wɛ gɔ́. "
"With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God's likeness. ","É wɛ mǐ nɔ zé dó dó kú nú Aklúnɔ Tɔ́ mǐtɔn; é wɛ mǐ ka nɔ lɛ́ zé dó dó nu gbɛtɔ́ e Mawu bló, bɔ é nyí akpajlɛ́ tɔn ɔ́ ná. "
"Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers, this should not be. ","Kúdónúmɛ sín xó kpó nudómɛ sín xó kpó nɔ tɔ́n sín nu ɖokpó ɔ́ mɛ. Nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, é ɖó ná nyí mɔ̌ ǎ. "
Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring? ,Tɔjɔtɛn ɖé nɔ tɔ́n sin e víví é kpó sin e vɛ́ ɔ́ kpó gbɔn ali ɖokpó ɔ́ nu ǎ. 
"My brothers, can a fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water. ","Nɔví ce lɛ́ɛ mi, fígitín ɖé sixú sɛ́n olívu ǎ; vǐwuntín ɖé sixú sɛ́n fígi ǎ; mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, tɔjɔtɛn e sín sin nɔ vɛ́ jɛ ɔ́ sixú ná sin víví ǎ. "
"Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show it by his good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom. ","Mɛ ɖé ɖo mi mɛ, bó tunwun nǔ, bó lɛ́ ɖó nǔnywɛ́ a?

"But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth. ","Lo ɔ́, ényí wǔhwinhwan baɖabaɖa kpó agbahwlɛ́nxámɛ sín ayixa kpó ɖo xomɛ nú mi hǔn, mi ma jlá ajɔ̌ nú miɖée ó; mi ma gbɛ́ nǔgbó ɖɔ, lobo ɖó nǔvú ó. "
"Such “wisdom” does not come down from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual, of the devil. ",Nǔnywɛ́ mɔ̌hunkɔtɔn gosín Mawu gɔn ǎ
"For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and every evil practice. ","Đó fí e wǔhwinhwan ɖe, bɔ agbahwlɛ́nxámɛ sín ayixa ɖe ɔ́, nǔ hannyahannya wiwa kpó nǔ nyanya wiwa tɛnmɛ tɛnmɛ bǐ kpó lɔ ɖo fínɛ́. "
"But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere. ","Lo ɔ́, nǔnywɛ́ e gosín Mawu gɔ́n ɔ́, nǔ mímɛ́ wɛ é to nyí hwɛ̌; énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, é nɔ ba tagba ǎ; é fá bó nɔ lɛ́ hun xomɛ dó wa nǔ nú mɛ; é nyɔ́ xomɛ ɖésú, bó nɔ wa nǔ ɖagbe lɛ́ɛ; é nɔ nɔ mɛɖé jí ǎ; é ka nɔ wa yɛmɛnú ǎ.

Peacemakers who sow in peace raise a harvest of righteousness.What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don't they come from your desires that battle within you? ,"Mɛ e nɔ ɖe fífá sín ali lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó yěɖée lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, fífá mɛ wɛ yě nɔ dó nǔ dó, bɔ jinukún e yě nɔ ya ɔ́ nyí gbɛ jlɔ́jlɔ́.Fítɛ́ ahwan e ɖo tɛ́ntin mitɔn lɛ́ɛ kpódó jlɛ e ɖo tɛ́ntin mitɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó ka nɔ gosín?

"You want something but don't get it. You kill and covet, but you cannot have what you want. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask God. ","Mi nɔ jló mɛɖévonú; lo ɔ́, mi sixú mɔ ǎ; bɔ énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, mi ɖo gbesisɔ mɛ, bó ná hu mɛ; nǔ nɔ jló mi; mi ka sixú mɔ ǎ, bɔ énɛ́ ɔ́ nɔ́ zɔ́n bɔ mi nɔ jɛ jlɛ ɖɔ jí, bó nɔ jɛ ahwan fun jí.

"When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures. ","Mi na bo byɔ́ ɔ́, mi nɔ mɔ ǎ, ɖó ayixa nyanya wɛ mi nɔ dó byɔ́: nǔ e byɔ́ wɛ mi ɖe ɔ́, mi jló ná zán nú mi ɖésúnɔ sín gbɛɖuɖu. "
"You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God. ","Nǔ gbejímánɔ-númawutɔ́ élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ! Mi tunwun ɖɔ è zun xɔ́ntɔn xá gbɛ ɔ́, Mawu sín kɛntɔ́ wɛ è nyǐ ǎ cé? Mɛ e jló ná nyí gbɛmɛ fí sín nǔ lɛ́ɛ sín xɔ́ntɔn ɔ́ nɔ sɔ́ éɖée dó húzú Mawu sín kɛntɔ́. "
Or do you think Scripture says without reason that the spirit he caused to live in us envies intensely? ,Mi ma vɛdó ɖɔ yǎyá wɛ è wlǎn xó élɔ́ dó Mawuxówéma ɔ́ mɛ sín ó: è wlǎn ɖɔ: “Mawu nɔ zé wǔhwinhwan dó byɔ́ yɛ e é sɔ́ dó mǐ mɛ ɔ́ ná.” 
But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says: “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” ,"É ɖo mɔ̌ có, é nɔ lɛ́ ná fɛ́nú e hú gǎn mɔ̌ ɔ́ mǐ; ɖó Mawuxówéma ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Mawu nɔ gbɛ́ goyítɔ́ lɛ́ɛ sín xó; lo ɔ́, é nɔ ná fɛ́nú mɛ e nɔ sɔ́ yěɖée hwe lɛ́ɛ.” "
"Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. ","Hǔn, mi bo hwíhwɛ́ miɖée ɖó Mawu glɔ́; mi ló dǒ ɖo awǒvi nukɔn; énɛ́ ɔ́, é ná hɔn yi zɔ nú mi. "

"Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up. ","Mi sɔ́ miɖée hwe ɖo Aklúnɔ nukɔn, énɛ́ ɔ́ é ná sɔ́ mi su. "
"Brothers, do not slander one another. Anyone who speaks against his brother or judges him speaks against the law and judges it.

Your gold and silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last days. ,Siká mitɔn kpó kpatágan mitɔn kpó jɛ ko
Look! The wages you failed to pay the workmen who mowed your fields are crying out against you.

He must turn from evil and do good,Fon
"For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.” ","ɖó Aklúnɔ sín nukún ɖo mɛ e nɔ wa nǔ jlɔ́jlɔ́ lɛ́ɛ jí, é ɖo gbesisɔ mɛ, bó ná ɖótó ɖɛ yětɔn. Amɔ̌, é nɔ ɖe kɔ dó nǔnyanyawatɔ́ lɛ́ɛ.” "
Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good? ,"Ényí mi nɔ bí dó nǔ ɖagbe wiwa wú ɔ́, mɛ̌ ka ná wa nǔ nyanya dó mi wú? "
"But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. “Do not fear what they fear ; do not be frightened.” ","Ényí é ná bó byɔ́ ɖɔ mi ná ji ya ɖó mi ɖo nǔ jlɔ́jlɔ́ wa wɛ wú hǔn, nǔ nyɔ́ nú mi. Mi ma ɖi xɛsi ɖěbǔ nú gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ó; mi ma ka jó miɖée dó nú è gba ayi dó nú mi ó. "
"But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have.

"For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God.

"and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also–not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, ","Nǔ e sín akpajlɛ́ nyí wɛ sin ɔ́ ɖe ɔ́ wɛ nyí yɛhwesin e ɖo mi lɔ hwlɛngán wɛ din e.

"who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand–with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him.Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, because he who has suffered in his body is done with sin. ","Jezu Klísu ɔ́ wɛ yi sɛ́xwé bó jínjɔ́n ɖisíxwé nú Mawu; fínɛ́ wɛ é ɖu axɔ́sú nú wɛnsagun lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpó acɛkpikpa lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpó, kpódó hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpán ɖe.Đó Klísu ji ya ɖo agbaza mɛ wútu ɔ́, mi lɔmɔ̌ mi bo dó wǔsyɛ́n lanmɛ nú miɖée, bó ɖó ninɔmɛ ɖokpó ɔ́ ɖo ayixa mɛ; ɖó mɛ e dɛ ɖo yajiji agbaza mɛ tɔn lɛ́ɛ nu ɔ́ sɔ́ ɖó nǔɖé xá hwɛhuhu ǎ.

"As a result, he does not live the rest of his earthly life for evil human desires, but rather for the will of God. ","Hǔn, bɛ́ sín din ɔ́, gbɛ e kpo bɔ mi ná zán ɖo ayǐkúngban jí fí ɔ́, lě e Mawu jló gbɔn ɔ́ wɛ mi ɖó ná zán gbɔn; é nyí jlǒ gbɛtɔ́ tɔn wɛ mi ná xwedó ǎ. "
"For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do–living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry.

"They think it strange that you do not plunge with them into the same flood of dissipation, and they heap abuse on you. ","Din ɔ́, ée mɛ ma ɖi nǔ nú Mawu ǎ lɛ́ɛ mɔ ɖɔ mi kún sɔ́ nɔ ɖo nǔwazɛjlɛ̌wú sín gbɛ nyanya énɛ́ ɔ́ zán xá émí wɛ ó ɔ́, é kpácá yě, bɔ yě bɔ zun ɖó nú mi. "
But they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. ,"Amɔ̌, yě ná ɖó nǔ e yě wa lɛ́ɛ sín gbe nú Mawu e ɖo gbesisɔ mɛ, bó ná ɖɔ hwɛ xá mɛ e ɖo gbɛ lɛ́ɛ kpódó mɛ e kú lɛ́ɛ kpó é. "
"For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, so that they might be judged according to men in regard to the body, but live according to God in regard to the spirit. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wútu wɛ è jlǎ Wɛn Ɖagbe ɔ́ mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌; bónú ée yě ko gbɔn hwɛɖɔxámɛ e ɖo te kpɔ́n gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɔ́ mɛ dín ɖo agbaza mɛ ɔ́, yě ná nɔ gbɛ gbɔn Yɛsinsɛn jí lě e Mawu ɖo gbɛ gbɔn é. "
The end of all things is near. Therefore be clear minded and self-controlled so that you can pray. ,Hwenu nǔ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ná vɔ dó ɔ́ ko yá

"If anyone speaks, he should do it as one speaking the very words of God. If anyone serves, he should do it with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.

"If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. ","Nú è ɖo mi zun wɛ ɖó mi nyí ahwanvú Klísu tɔn wútu hǔn, nǔ nyɔ́ nú mi, ɖó Yɛ susunɔ, Yɛ Mawu tɔn ɔ́ ɖo mi jí. "

"For it is time for judgment to begin with the family of God; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God? ","Hwenu e hwɛɖiɖɔ ná bɛ́ dó ɔ́ ko su; xwédo Mawu tɔn ɔ́ wɛ è ka ná ɖɔ hwɛ xá jɛ nukɔn.

"So then, those who suffer according to God's will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.To the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow elder, a witness of Christ's sufferings and one who also will share in the glory to be revealed: ","Ényí mɔ̌ hǔn, mɛ e ɖo ya ji wɛ lě e Mawu jló gbɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖó ná ɖó kan dó ɖagbewiwa wú, bó ná sɔ́ yěɖée bǐ sésé dó alɔ mɛ nú Gbɛɖótɔ́ e ɖo gbejí é.Din ɔ́, mɛ e nyí agunmɛxó ɖo mi mɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ xó ná wɛ un ɖe.

","Nǔgbó ɔ́, é nyí hwenuxó e è sɔ́ bǐbí dó kpa ná ɔ́ ɖě wú wɛ mǐ gán jɛ, bó dó kplɔ́n nǔ mi ɖɔ Aklúnɔ mǐtɔn Jezu Klísu ná wá kpó hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n kpó ǎ; lo ɔ́, mǐ mɔ susu ɖaxó e é ɖó ɔ́ kpó nukún mǐ ɖésúnɔ tɔn kpó.

"For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.” ","Hwenu e Mawu Tɔ́ ɔ́ wlí yɛ̌yi n'i, bó sɔ́ ɛ su ɔ́, mǐ ɖo fínɛ́; hwenɛ́nu ɔ́, gbe ɖé ɖi sín Mawu susuɖaxónɔ ɔ́ gɔ́n wá gɔ̌n tɔn, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Vǐ ce vívɛ́ná wɛ mɛ élɔ́ nyí; xomɛ nɔ hun mì dó wǔtu tɔn.” "
We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain. ,"Mǐ ɖésúnɔ ɔ́, hwenu e mǐ kpó é kpó ɖo só mímɛ́ ɔ́ jí ɔ́, mǐ se gbe énɛ́ e ɖi sín jǐxwé é. "
"And we have the word of the prophets made more certain, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ zɔ́n bɔ mǐ lɛ́ ɖó jiɖiɖe dó wɛn e gbeyíɖɔ Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ dó ɔ́ wú ganjí.

"Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation. ",Nǔ e mi ka ná tunwun ganjí hwɛ̌ ɔ́ ɖíe: mɛ ɖěbǔ sixú sɔ́ nǔnywɛ́ é ɖésúnɔ tɔn dó tín Mawuxó e è wlǎn ɔ́ mɛ ná ǎ. 
"For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them–bringing swift destruction on themselves. ","Đó mɛ ɖěbǔ nɔ sɔ́ jlǒ é ɖésúnɔ tɔn kpowun dó ɖɔ Mawuxó ɔ́ ná kpɔ́n gbeɖé ǎ; lo ɔ́, Yɛsinsɛn wɛ nɔ sɔ́ dó ayi mɛ nú gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, bɔ yě nɔ ɖɔ xó e Mawu ɖɔ yě ní ɖɔ é.Đ'ayǐ xóxó ɔ́, gbeyíɖɔmawutɔn-nyíjɛtɔ́ ɖé lɛ́ɛ tɔ́n ɖo togun ɔ́ mɛ; mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, nǔkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́-nyíjɛtɔ́ ɖé lɛ́ɛ ná tɔ́n ɖo tɛ́ntin mitɔn; yě ná sɔ́ kplɔ́n nyanya, kplɔ́n e nɔ hɛn nǔ gblé ɔ́ byɔ́ mi mɛ, bó ná gbɛ́ gǎn e hwlɛ́n yě gán é; énɛ́ ɔ́, yě ná vɔ yěɖée bléwún. "
Many will follow their shameful ways and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. ,"Mɛ gěgé ná xwedó yě ɖo gbɛ kwíji kwíji énɛ́ e yě nɔ zán ɔ́ mɛ, bɔ lě e yě nɔ wa nǔ gbɔn ɔ́ ná zɔ́n bɔ è nǎ ɖɔ xó nyanya dó nǔgbó sín ali ɔ́ wú. "
"In their greed these teachers will exploit you with stories they have made up. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping. ","Nǔkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́-nyíjɛtɔ́ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ná nɔ ɖo akwɛ́ gbé mɛ, bó ná nɔ kpa xó ɖɔ nú mi, bó dó xo mi ɖu.

"For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them into gloomy dungeons to be held for judgment; ","Đó Mawu gɔn hwɛ ɖó nú wɛnsagun e hu hwɛ lɛ́ɛ é ǎ; lo ɔ́, é bɛ́ yě kɔn nyi zo mɛ, bɔ è hɛn yě dó wlɔ mɛ ɖo zǐnflú mɛ fínɛ́ nú hwɛɖɔzán gbe. "
"if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others; ","Mawu gɔn hwɛ ɖó nú gbɛ xóxó ɔ́ ǎ; lo ɔ́, é bló bɔ tɔ ɖi sin kpé fí bǐ, bɔ gbɛtɔ́ dídá e ɖo gbɛ énɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ kú tɔ.

"if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly; ","Mawu ɖó hwɛ nú Sodɔ́mu kpó Gomɔ́ɔ kpó, bó zé myɔ dó vɔ yě ná; é bló mɔ̌, bó dó ná nǔ e ɖo ná jɛ dó mɛdídá e ná wá lɛ́ɛ jí wɛ ɔ́ sín xlɛ́ ɖokpó yě. "
"and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men ","Mawu hwlɛ́n Lɔ̌ti gán; Lɔ̌ti ɔ́, nǔjlɔ́jlɔ́watɔ́ wɛ, bɔ gbɛ kwíji kwíji e gbɛtɔ́ dídá hwetɔnnu tɔn lɛ́ɛ zán ɔ́ vɛ́ n'i. "
"(for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)– ","Đó nya nǔjlɔ́jlɔ́watɔ́ énɛ́ e ɖo tɛ́ntin yětɔn ɔ́, ɖo nǔ e wa wɛ yě ɖe ɔ́ mɔ wɛ, bó ɖo sise wɛ, bɔ nǔ énɛ́ zɔ́n bɔ é nɔ mɔ wǔvɛ́ ayǐhɔ́ngbe ayǐhɔ́ngbe ɖo ayi tɔn mímɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ. "
"if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue godly men from trials and to hold the unrighteous for the day of judgment, while continuing their punishment. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, Aklúnɔ tunwun lě e é nɔ hwlɛ́n mɛ e nɔ ɖó sísí n'i lɛ́ɛ gán sín adǎngbomɛ lɛ́ɛ mɛ gbɔn é, bó lɛ́ tunwun lě e é nɔ sɔ́ yě mɛ e ɖo nǔ nyanya wa wɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖ'ayǐ gbɔn, bó ná dɔn tó nú yě ɖo hwɛɖɔzán gbe é. "
"This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the sinful nature and despise authority. Bold and arrogant, these men are not afraid to slander celestial beings; ","Yě mɛ e nɔ xwedó jlǒ kwíji kwíji gbɛtɔ́ e yě nyí ɔ́ tɔn, bó nɔ gbɛ́ wǎn nú acɛkpikpa Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɔ́ wɛ é ná dɔn tó ná tawun.

"yet even angels, although they are stronger and more powerful, do not bring slanderous accusations against such beings in the presence of the Lord. ","Wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖó hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n, bó ɖó acɛ hú nǔkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́-nyíjɛtɔ́ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ, yě nɔ zé zun dó dó hwɛ nǔɖíɖó susunɔ lɛ́ɛ ná ɖo Aklúnɔ nukɔn ǎ. "
"But these men blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like brute beasts, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed, and like beasts they too will perish. ","Amɔ̌, mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, yě nɔ lin tamɛ kpɔ́n cóbó nɔ wa nǔ ǎ; yě cí gběkanlin e jɔ, bɔ è nǎ wlí bó hu é ɖɔhun; yě nɔ zun nǔ e wú yě ma mɔ nukúnnú jɛ ǎ é; è nǎ hu yě lě e è nɔ hu gběkanlin lɛ́ɛ gbɔn é. "
"They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you. ","Mɔ̌ wɛ è nǎ sú hwɛ e yě hu lɛ́ɛ sín axɔ́ yě gbɔn.

"With eyes full of adultery, they never stop sinning; they seduce the unstable; they are experts in greed–an accursed brood! ","Aga nukún wɛ ɖo ta nú yě, bɔ hwɛhuhu nɔ ci kɔ nú yě gbeɖé ǎ. Yě nɔ ɖó mɔ nú mɛ e vɔ́ lɛ́ɛ, bɔ yě nɔ jɛ mɛ; nukúnkɛn wɛ yě nɔ dó; Mawu ko dó nu yě. "
"They have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam son of Beor, who loved the wages of wickedness. ","Yě gosín ali jlɔ́jlɔ́ ɔ́ jí, bó yi bú; Bosɔ́ɔ sín vǐ Baláamu e yí wǎn nú nǔ nyanya wiwa dó ɖu le ɔ́, ali e é gbɔn ɔ́ wɛ yě wlǐ. "
But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey–a beast without speech–who spoke with a man's voice and restrained the prophet's madness. ,"Lo ɔ́, è gbɛ̌ nǔ n'i, ɖó tóli e é vɛ́ ɔ́ wú.

These men are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them. ,Nǔkplɔ́nmɛtɔ́-nyíjɛtɔ́ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ cí tɔjɔtɛn e xusin é ɖɔhun
"For they mouth empty, boastful words and, by appealing to the lustful desires of sinful human nature, they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in error. ","Yě nɔ ɖo goyítɔ́ xó ɖɔ wɛ, bó nɔ ɖo xlonɔ xó ɖɔ wɛ; yě nɔ wlí mɛ e ma ko hɔn sín yě mɛ e ɖo ali bú wɛ lɛ́ɛ tɛ́ntin zinzin ǎ lɛ́ɛ dó mɔ mɛ; nǔblíblí wiwa sín jlǒ e yě ɖó ɖo gbɛtɔ́ nyínyí mɛ lɛ́ɛ wɛ yě nɔ́ dó wlí yě dó mɔ mɛ. "
"They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity–for a man is a slave to whatever has mastered him. ","Yě nɔ dó akpá nú yě ɖɔ yě ná jɛ yěɖée sí; lo ɔ́, jijɔ e nɔ dɔn mɛ yi kú lɛ́ɛ sín kannumɔ wɛ yě ɖésú ka nyí; ɖó kannumɔ wɛ mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó nyí nú nǔ e nɔ ɖu ɖo jǐ tɔn é. "
"If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning. ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, ényí yě mɛ e tunwun Jezu Klísu e nyí Aklúnɔ mǐtɔn, bó nyí Mɛhwlɛ́ngántɔ́ mǐtɔn, bó ma ka ko hɔn sín nǔblíblíwiwa gbɛmɛ fí tɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ zinzin ǎ lɛ́ɛ lɛ́ jó yěɖée dó nú nǔblíblíwiwa énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ, bɔ yě ɖu ɖo yě jí ɔ́, ninɔmɛ e yě nɔ wá ɖó ɖo vivɔnu ɔ́ nɔ lɛ́ nylá hú ée yě ko ɖó ɖo bǐbɛ́mɛ é. "
"It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them. ","Ényí yě gbɔ bó gɔn ali jlɔ́jlɔ́ ɔ́ tunwun ɔ́, é nyɔ́ nú yě hú ɖɔ yě ní tunwun bó ka wá lɛ́ kɔ sín nǔ mímɛ́ e è ɖɔ yě ní wa lɛ́ɛ gúdo. "
"Of them the proverbs are true: “A dog returns to its vomit,” and, “A sow that is washed goes back to her wallowing in the mud.”Dear friends, this is now my second letter to you. I have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking. ","Nǔ e jɛ dó yě jí ɔ́ sɔgbe xá xó e lǒ élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ é: “Cukú bɛ́ nǔ e é vi ɔ́ ɖu”, abǐ “Aglǔza e è lɛ wǔ ná din tlóló ɔ́ lɛ́ lɛ́ kɔ yi lɛ babá.”Mɛvívɛ́ná ce lɛ́ɛ mi, wěma wegɔ́ ɔ́ ɖíe wlán sɛ́ dó mi wɛ un ɖe e.

I want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our Lord and Savior through your apostles. ,"Un jló ɖɔ mi ná nɔ flín xó e gbeyíɖɔ mímɛ́ Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ ɖ'ayǐ xóxó lɛ́ɛ kpódó nǔ e Aklúnɔ Mɛhwlɛ́ngántɔ́ zɔ́n ɖɔ mi ní wa, bɔ mɛsɛ́dó mitɔn lɛ́ɛ kplɔ́n mi ɔ́ kpán. "
"First of all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. ","Nǔ e mi ná tunwun jɛ nukɔn ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ: ɖo azǎn gǔdo gúdo tɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɔ́, mɛ e nɔ zán gbɛ yětɔn lě e jlǒ yě ɖésúnɔ tɔn ba gbɔn lɛ́ɛ ná ɖe yěɖée xlɛ́. Yě ná ɖɔ slǎmɛ mi wú, "
"They will say, “Where is this ‘coming’ he promised? Ever since our fathers died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.” ","bó ná ɖɔ: “É dó akpá ɖɔ émí ná wá; mɔ̌ wɛ ǎ cé?

But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water. ,"Yě nɔ jló bó nɔ wɔn ɖɔ é ko lín din bɔ Mawu ɖɔ xó bɔ jǐnukúnsin kpó ayǐkúngban kpó tíin. Ayǐkúngban ɔ́, sin mɛ wɛ è dɔn ɛ sín; sin wɛ é dó bló ná. "
By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. ,"Mɔ̌ ɖokpó ɔ́, sin wɛ Mawu dó vɔ gbɛ xóxó ɔ́ ná; tɔ ɖi sin kpé fí bǐ; sin énɛ́ wɛ é dó vɔ gbɛ ɔ́ ná. "
"By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men. ","Lo ɔ́, xó ɖokpó ɔ́ wɛ Mawu dó zé jǐnukúnsin kpó ayǐkúngban din tɔn ɔ́ kpó ɖ'ayǐ, bó ná wá zé myɔ dó vɔ yě ná. É hɛn yě ɖó te nú gbe e gbe é ná wá ɖó hwɛ nú mɛ nyanya lɛ́ɛ, bó ná vɔ yě dó é. "
"But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day. ","Lo ɔ́, nɔví ce vívɛ́ná lɛ́ɛ mi, nǔ ɖokpó ka tíin, bɔ mi ɖó ná wɔn ǎ: é wɛ nyí ɖɔ, ɖo Aklúnɔ nukɔn ɔ́, azǎn ɖokpó cí xwe afatɔ́n ɖɔhun, bɔ xwe afatɔ́n cí azǎn ɖokpó ɖɔhun. "
"The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance. ","Aklúnɔ nɔ lín có bó nɔ ɖe akpá e é dó lɛ́ɛ, lě e mɛɖé lɛ́ɛ nɔ vɛdó ɔ́ ǎ.

"But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything in it will be laid bare. ","É ka ɖo mɔ̌ có, Aklúnɔ sín azǎn ɔ́ ná wá ajotɔ́ ɖɔhun.

"Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives ","Ée é nyí ɖɔ nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ná vɔ gbɔn mɔ̌ ɔ́, mi mɔ nukúnnú jɛ ninɔmɛ e mi ɖó ná ɖó ɔ́ wú ganjí. Mi ɖó ná nɔ zán gbɛ mímɛ́, bó ná nɔ ɖó sísí nú Mawu, "
"as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat. ","lobo ná ɖo te kpɔ́n azǎn tɔn, bó ná ɖo nǔ e wú mi kpé ɔ́ bǐ wa wɛ, bónú é ná yá wǔ wá.

"But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, the home of righteousness. ","Amɔ̌, Mawu dó jǐnukúnsin yɔ̌yɔ́ kpó ayǐkúngban yɔ̌yɔ́ kpó sín akpá; fínɛ́ wɛ è nǎ nɔ wa nǔ kpódó hwɛjijɔ kpán ɖe; nǔ e mǐ ɖo te kpɔ́n ɔ́ nɛ́. "
"So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ wú ɔ́, nɔví ce vívɛ́ná lɛ́ɛ mi, ée mi ɖo te kpɔ́n nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ sín jijɛ ɔ́, mi bo ɖo nǔ e wú mi kpé ɔ́ bǐ wa wɛ, bó ná dó nyí mɛ mímɛ́ ma ɖó blɔ̌ ɖo wǔ ɖo Mawu nukɔn, bó ná dó nɔ fífá mɛ kpó Mawu kpó. "
"Bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him. ","Mi ní tunwun ɖɔ suúlu e Aklúnɔ mǐtɔn ɖó ɔ́ wɛ nyí hwlɛngán mitɔn, lě e Mawu ná nǔnywɛ́ nɔví mǐtɔn vívɛ́ná Pɔ́lu, bɔ é lɔmɔ̌ wlán sɛ́ dó mi gbɔn é. "
"He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction. ","Wěma e mɛ é ɖɔ xó dó nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ wú ɖe lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɔ́, nǔ e é wlán d'é mɛ lɛ́ɛ nɛ́.

"Therefore, dear friends, since you already know this, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your secure position. ","Amɔ̌, nɔví ce vívɛ́ná lɛ́ɛ mi, midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, è ko ɖɔ xó énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖ'ayǐ nú mi din.

"But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever!

This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light,Fon

"He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. ","É wɛ sɔ́ éɖée dó sá vɔ̌ ná, bónú Mawu ná sɔ́ hwɛ mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ kɛ mǐ. É ká nyí hwɛ mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ tɔn kɛ́ɖɛ́ wɛ Mawu ná sɔ́ kɛ mǐ ǎ; é ná lɛ́ sɔ́ gbɛtɔ́ bǐ sín hwɛ kɛ yě. "
We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands. ,"Ényí mǐ nɔ nyi sɛ́n tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mǐ hɛn ɔ́, mǐ nǎ ɖeji ɖɔ mǐ tunwun i. "
"The man who says, “I know him,” but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. ","Nú mɛɖé ɖɔ: “Un tunwun i”, bó ka gbɛ́ sɛ́n tɔn lɛ́ɛ nyi hǔn, adingbannɔ wɛ nyí mɛ énɛ́, bɔ nǔgbó ɔ́ ɖo mɛ énɛ́ mɛ ǎ. "
"But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him: ","Amɔ̌, mɛ e nɔ se tónú nú xó tɔn ɔ́, mɛ énɛ́ ɖó wǎn yíyí titewungbe bɔ nǔ bǐ vɔ ɖ'é wú. Lě e mǐ hɛn ɔ́, mǐ nǎ tunwun ɖɔ mǐ ɖo bǔ xá Jezu Klísu gbɔn ɔ́ ɖíe: "
Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did. ,mɛ e ɖɔ émí ɖo bǔ xá ɛ ɔ́ ɖó ná zán gbɛ tɔn lě e é ɖésúnɔ zán gbɛ tɔn gbɔn é. 
"Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. ","Mɛvívɛ́ná ce lɛ́ɛ mi, sɛ́n yɔ̌yɔ́ ɖěvo wlán sɛ́ dó mi wɛ un ɖe ǎ; sɛ́n xóxó e mi ko ɖó sín hwenu e mi ɖi nǔ nú Klísu é wɛ. Sɛ́n xóxó énɛ́ ɔ́, xó e mi ko se é wɛ. "
"Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining. ","É ka ɖo mɔ̌ có, sɛ́n yɔ̌yɔ́ wɛ é nyí, bɔ un ɖo wlǎnwlán sɛ́ dó mi wɛ, bɔ nǔgbó sɛ́n énɛ́ tɔn ɖe éɖée xlɛ́ gbɔn Klísu mɛ, bó ɖe éɖée xlɛ́ ɖo mǐ lɔmɔ̌ mɛ, ɖó zǐnflú ɔ́ ko ɖo yiyi wɛ, bɔ wěziza titewungbe ɔ́ ko ɖo hǐnhɔ́n wɛ.

Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness. ,"Mɛ e ɖɔ émí ɖo gbɛ zán wɛ ɖo wěziza mɛ, bó ka gbɛ́ wǎn nú nɔví tɔn ɔ́ kpo ɖo gbɛ zán wɛ ɖo zǐnflú mɛ. "
"Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble. ","Mɛ e yí wǎn nú nɔví tɔn ɔ́ nɔ́ nɔ wěziza mɛ; énɛ́ ɔ́, nǔ ɖěbǔ ɖo wǔ tɔn bó ná dɔn mɛ ɖěvo dó hwɛ mɛ ǎ. "
"But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness; he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded him. ","Mɛ e ka gbɛ́ wǎn nú nɔví tɔn ɔ́ ɖo zǐnflú mɛ; é ɖo zɔnlin ɖi wɛ ɖo zǐnflú mɛ; é tunwun fí e é xwe ɔ́ ǎ, ɖó zǐnflú ɔ́ zɔ́n bɔ é ɖo nǔ mɔ wɛ ǎ. "
"I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. ","Vǐ ce lɛ́ɛ mi, un ɖo wěma wlán sɛ́ dó mi wɛ, ɖó Mawu sɔ́ hwɛ mitɔn lɛ́ɛ kɛ mi ɖo Jezu Klísu nyíkɔ mɛ. "
"I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, dear children, because you have known the Father. ","Vǐtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ mi, un ɖo wěma wlán sɛ́ dó mi wɛ, ɖó mi tunwun mɛ e ko tíin sín bǐbɛ́mɛ é.

"I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one. ","Vǐ ce lɛ́ɛ mi, un ɖo wěma wlán sɛ́ dó mi wɛ, ɖó mi tunwun Tɔ́ ɔ́.

"Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. ","Mi ma yí wǎn nú gbɛ ɔ́ ó; mi ma ka yí wǎn nú nǔ e nyí gbɛ ɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖěbǔ ó. Ényí mɛɖé yí wǎn nú gbɛ ɔ́ hǔn, é ɖó wǎn yíyí nú Tɔ́ ɔ́ ǎ. "
"For everything in the world–the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does–comes not from the Father but from the world. ","Đó nǔ e nyí gbɛ ɔ́ tɔn ɔ́ ɖě gosín Tɔ́ ɔ́ gɔ́n ǎ; gbɛtɔ́ sín jlǒ nyanya lɛ́ɛ, nukún ɖo mɛ gban mɛ, kpó goyíyí e dɔkun jijɛ nɔ zɔ́n mɛ é kpán ɖě gosín Tɔ́ ɔ́ gɔ́n ǎ; gbɛmɛ fí núwiwa lɛ́ɛ wɛ. "
"The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever. ","Gbɛ élɔ́ ɔ́, wǐwá yi wɛ é ɖe, bɔ mɛ e nɔ bló jlǒ gbɛ élɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ lɔ ɖo wǐwá yi wɛ; mɛ e nɔ bló jlǒ Mawu tɔn ɔ́ ka nɔ́ nɔ gbɛ káká sɔ́yi. "
"Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour. ","Vǐ ce lɛ́ɛ mi, hwenu gǔdo gúdo tɔn mɛ ɖíe mǐ ɖe e; mi ka ko se ɖɔ kɛntɔ́ Klísu tɔn ɔ́ ɖó ná wá; amɔ̌ din ɔ́, Klísu sín kɛntɔ́ gěgé ko wá.

"They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. ","Mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ gosín mǐ mɛ, ɖó yě nyí mɛ mǐtɔn ɖě ɖ'ayǐ ǎ; ɖó nú yě ko nyí mɛ mǐtɔn wɛ ɔ́, yě ná ko nɔ mǐ mɛ; yě ka gosín mǐ mɛ, bónú è nǎ mɔ nukúnnú jɛ mɛ céɖécéɖé ɖɔ yě ɖěbǔ kún ko nyí mɛ mǐtɔn ɖ'ayǐ ó.

"But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. ","Midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, Klísu kɔn Yɛsinsɛn dó mi jí; énɛ́ ɔ́ wɛ zɔ́n bɔ mi bǐ tunwun nǔgbó ɔ́. "
"I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. ","Hǔn, ényí mi dán nǔgbó ɔ́ wú wɛ un ɖo nǔ élɔ́ wlán sɛ́ dó mi wɛ ǎ. Mi tunwun nǔ e nyí nǔgbó ɔ́ é, bó ka lɛ́ tunwun ɖɔ nǔvú ɖěbǔ kún nɔ tɔ́n sín nǔgbó ɔ́ mɛ ó. "
Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist–he denies the Father and the Son. ,Mɛ̌ ka ɖo nǔvúɖótɔ́ ɔ́ nyí wɛ? Mɛ e ɖɔ Jezu kún nyí Klísu ɔ́ ó é wɛ
No one who denies the Son has the Father,Fon
"See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. ","Mi hɛn xó e mi se sín hwenu e mi ɖi nǔ nú Klísu ɔ́ dó ayi mitɔn mɛ.

And this is what he promised us–even eternal life. ,Nǔ e sín akpá Klísu ka dó nú mǐ ɔ́ wɛ nyí gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ. 
I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. ,"Un ɖo nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ wlán sɛ́ dó mi wɛ, bó dó ɖo xó ɖɔ dó mɛ e nɔ ba ná flú mi lɛ́ɛ wú wɛ. "
"As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit–just as it has taught you, remain in him. ","Midɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, Yɛsinsɛn e Klísu kɔn dó mi jí ɔ́ ɖo mi jí; hǔn, é sɔ́ byɔ́ ɖɔ mɛɖé ní kplɔ́n nǔ mi ǎ.

"And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming. ","Din ɔ́, vǐ ce lɛ́ɛ mi, mi nɔ bǔ xá Klísu, bónú hwenu e é ná ɖe éɖée xlɛ́ ɔ́, mǐ ná ɖó gǎnjɛwú kpíkpé; hwenu e é ná lɛ́ kɔ wá ɔ́, winnyá ní ma hu mǐ ɖo nukɔn tɔn ó. "
"If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. ","Ée mi tunwun ɖɔ nǔ jlɔ́jlɔ́ wɛ Klísu nɔ wa ɔ́, mi bo tunwun ɖɔ mɛ ɖěbǔ e nɔ wa nǔ jlɔ́jlɔ́ ɔ́, Klísu tɔn wɛ mɛ énɛ́ nyí.Mi Kpɔ́n lě e Tɔ́ ɔ́ yí wǎn nú mǐ sɔ é.

"Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. ","Mɛvívɛ́ná ce lɛ́ɛ mi, din ɔ́, Mawu ví wɛ mǐ nyí; amɔ̌, è ko ɖe nǔ e mi ná wá nyí ɔ́ xlɛ́ céɖécéɖé ǎ.

"Everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as he is pure. ","Mɛ ɖěbǔ ɖó nukún ɖíɖó énɛ́ ɖo Klísu mɛ hǔn, éɖée bló ɖó mǐmɛ́ jí wɛ é ɖe lě e Jezu Klísu ɖésúnɔ nyí mǐmɛ́ gbɔn é. "
"Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness. ","Mɛ e nɔ hu hwɛ é ɖěbǔ ɔ́, Mawusɛ́n gba wɛ é ɖe; ɖó hwɛhuhu ɔ́, Mawusɛ́n gbigba wɛ. "
But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him is no sin. ,"Mi ka tunwun ɖɔ Klísu wá, bó ná ɖe hwɛ lɛ́ɛ síin; hwɛ ɖě ka ɖo ayi tɔn mɛ ǎ. "
No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, mɛ ɖěbǔ ɖo Jezu Klísu mɛ ɔ́, mɛ ɔ́ sɔ́ nɔ hu hwɛ ǎ; mɛ e nɔ ɖo hwɛ hu wɛ ɔ́ mɔ ɛ ǎ, é ka tunwun i ǎ. "
"Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. He who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous. ","Vǐ ce lɛ́ɛ mi, mi ma lɔn nú mɛɖé blɛ́ mi ó; mɛ e nɔ wa nǔ jlɔ́jlɔ́ ɔ́, hwɛjijɔnɔ wɛ é nyí, lě e Klísu nyí hwɛjijɔnɔ é. "
"He who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil's work. ","Mɛ e nɔ ɖo hwɛ hu wɛ ɔ́, awǒvi tɔn wɛ é nyí, ɖó awǒvi ɔ́ ko ɖo hwɛ hu wɛ sín do, bɔ Mawu ví ɔ́ ka wá, bó ná sú awǒvi sín nǔwiwa lɛ́ɛ sín kún dó. "
"No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God's seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God. ","Mɛ ɖěbǔ nyí Mawu ví ɔ́, mɛ ɔ́ sɔ́ nɔ hu hwɛ ǎ, ɖó gbɛ Mawu tɔn ɖo mɛ énɛ́ mɛ. Đó ée Mawu nyí Tɔ́ tɔn ɔ́, é sixú kpo ɖo hwɛ hu wɛ ǎ. "
This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not a child of God,Fon
This is the message you heard from the beginning: We should love one another. ,"Nǔgbó ɔ́, xó e mi se sín hwenu e mi ɖi nǔ nú Klísu ɔ́ wɛ nyí mǐ ɖó ná yí wǎn nú mǐɖée. "
"Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brother's were righteous. ","Mǐ ɖó ná cí Kanyɛ́ɛ ɖɔhun ǎ, ɖó mɛ nyanya ɔ́ tɔn wɛ éyɛ́ ko nyí, bó hu nɔví tɔn. Étɛ́wú é ka hu nɔví tɔn?

"Do not be surprised, my brothers, if the world hates you. ","Énɛ́ wú ɔ́ nɔví lɛ́ɛ mi, ényí mɛ e nyí gbɛ élɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ gbɛ́ wǎn nú mi hǔn, ní ma kpácá mi ó. "
"We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love our brothers. Anyone who does not love remains in death. ","Mǐ tunwun ɖɔ mǐ gosín kú wá gbɛ; mǐ tunwun mɔ̌, ɖó mǐ yí wǎn nú nɔví mǐtɔn lɛ́ɛ. Mɛ e ma ka yí wǎn nú mɛ ǎ é kpo ɖo kú. "
"Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life in him. ","Mɛ ɖěbǔ gbɛ́ wǎn nú nɔví tɔn hǔn, mɛhutɔ́ wɛ é nyí; mi ka tunwun ɖɔ mɛhutɔ́ ɖěbǔ kún ɖó gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ ó. "
This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers. ,Lě e mǐ tunwun nǔ e wǎn yíyí nyí ɔ́ gbɔn ɔ́ ɖíe: Klísu sɔ́ gbɛ tɔn jó dó ta mǐtɔn mɛ
"If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need but has no pity on him, how can the love of God be in him? ","Ényí mɛɖé jɛ dɔkun, bó mɔ ɖɔ nǔɖé hudó nɔví émítɔn, bó ka ɖo nukún syɛ́n dó e wɛ ɔ́, nɛ̌ wǎn yíyí Mawu tɔn ka sixú nɔ mɛ énɛ́ sín ayi mɛ gbɔn? "
"Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth. ","Vǐ ce lɛ́ɛ mi, mi ma nú mǐ ní nɔ́ yí wǎn nú mɛ ɖo nu kpó xó víví kpó kpowun ó; lo ɔ́, wǎn yíyí titewungbe e nɔ ɖe éɖée xlɛ́ gbɔn nǔwiwa lɛ́ɛ mɛ ɔ́ wɛ mǐ ɖó ná ɖó. "
"This then is how we know that we belong to the truth, and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence ",Lě e mǐ ná tunwun ɖɔ mǐ nyí nǔgbó ɔ́ tɔn gbɔn ɔ́ nɛ́
"whenever our hearts condemn us. For God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. ","Ényí ayi mǐtɔn ná bó ɖo hwɛ ɖó nú mǐ wɛ ɔ́, mǐ ní tunwun ɖɔ Mawu hú gǎn ayi mǐtɔn, lobo tunwun nǔ bǐ. "

"And this is his command: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us. ","Nǔ e zɔ́n mǐ wɛ Mawu ɖe ɔ́ wɛ nyí ɖɔ mǐ ní ɖi nǔ nú vǐ tɔn Jezu Klísu ɔ́ sín nyǐkɔ, bó ka yí wǎn nú mǐɖée lě e Klísu zɔ́n mǐ gbɔn é. "
"Those who obey his commands live in him, and he in them. And this is how we know that he lives in us: We know it by the Spirit he gave us.Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. ","Mɛ e nɔ nyi Mawusɛ́n lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mɛ ɔ́ ɖo Mawu mɛ, bɔ Mawu ɖo éyɛ́ mɛ.

"In this way, love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment, because in this world we are like him. ","Ényí wǎn yíyí ɔ́ sɔgbe ɖo ayi mǐtɔn mɛ bɔ nǔ bǐ vɔ ɖ'é wú ɔ́, mǐ ná ɖó gǎnjɛwú kpíkpé ɖo hwɛɖɔzán gbe, ɖó gbɛ e mǐ zán ɖo gbɛ élɔ́ mɛ ɔ́ cí Klísu tɔn ɖɔhun. "
"There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love. ","Xɛsi ɖo wǎn yíyí mɛ ǎ; wǎn yíyí e sɔgbe bɔ nǔ bǐ vɔ ɖ'é wú ɔ́ nɔ nya xɛsi tɔ́n. Tódɔnnúmɛ wɛ nɔ dɔn xɛsi wá; ɖó mɛ e ɖo xɛsi ɖi wɛ ɔ́, mɛ énɛ́ ɔ́ ɖó wǎn yíyí bɔ nǔ bǐ vɔ ɖ'é wú ǎ. "
We love because he first loved us. ,"Mǐdɛɛ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, mǐ yí wǎn nú Mawu, ɖó é wɛ yí wǎn nú mǐ jɛ nukɔn. "
"If anyone says, “I love God,” yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen. ","Ényí mɛɖé ka ɖɔ émí yí wǎn nú Mawu, bó ka gbɛ́ wǎn nú nɔví tɔn hǔn, adingbannɔ wɛ é nyí; ɖó mɛ e ma yí wǎn nú nɔví tɔn e mɔ wɛ é ɖe ɔ́ ǎ ɔ́, nɛ̌ é ka na sixú yí wǎn nú Mawu e mɔ wɛ é ma ɖe ǎ é gbɔn? "
"And he has given us this command: Whoever loves God must also love his brother.Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well. ","Hǔn sɛ́n e Mawu ná mǐ ɔ́ ɖíe: mɛ e yí wǎn nú Mawu ɔ́ ɖó ná yí wǎn nú nɔví tɔn lɔmɔ̌.Mɛ ɖěbǔ ɖi nǔ ɖɔ Jezu wɛ nyí Klísu ɔ́ hǔn, mɛ ɔ́ nyí Mawu ví. Mɛ ɖěbǔ yí wǎn nú tɔ́ ɖé ɔ́, mɛ ɔ́ nɔ yí wǎn nú vǐ tɔn lɛ́ɛ lɔmɔ̌. "
This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands. ,"Ényí mǐ yí wǎn nú Mawu, bó nɔ nyi sɛ́n tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, énɛ́ wɛ ná zɔ́n bɔ mǐ ná tunwun ɖɔ mǐ yí wǎn nú vǐ tɔn lɛ́ɛ. "
"This is love for God: to obey his commands. And his commands are not burdensome, ",Wǎn yí nú Mawu wɛ nyí è nǐ nyi sɛ́n tɔn lɛ́ɛ
"for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith. ","ɖó Mawu ví ɖěbǔ hɛn ɔ́, é ná ɖu ɖo gbɛ ɔ́ jí. Nǔɖiɖi e mǐ ɖǒ ɔ́ wɛ ka nɔ zɔ́n bɔ mǐ nɔ ɖu ɖo gbɛ ɔ́ jí. "
Who is it that overcomes the world? Only he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. ,"Mɛ̌ ka sixú ɖu ɖo gbɛ ɔ́ jí? Mɛ e ɖi nǔ ɖɔ Jezu nyí Mawu ví ɔ́ kɛ́ɖɛ́ wɛ hɛn ɔ́, é ná ɖu ɖo gbɛ ɔ́ jí. "
"This is the one who came by water and blood–Jesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. ","Jezu Klísu wɛ nyí mɛ e wá é; é wɛ wá kpó sin kpó hun kpó; é wá kpó sin kɛ́ɖɛ́ kpó ǎ; lo ɔ́, é wá kpó sin kpó hun kpó, bɔ Yɛsinsɛn ka ɖo kúnnu ɖe ná wɛ ɖɔ nǔgbó wɛ, ɖó Yɛsinsɛn ɔ́, nǔgbó wɛ é nyí. "
For there are three that testify: ,Kúnnuɖetɔ́ atɔn wɛ ɖe
"the Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement. ","Yě wɛ nyí: Yɛsinsɛn, sin kpó hun kpó. Yě mɛ atɔn lɛ́ɛ sín gbe ɖo kpɔ́. "
"We accept man's testimony, but God's testimony is greater because it is the testimony of God, which he has given about his Son. ",Mǐ nɔ yí gbe nú kúnnuɖiɖe gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ tɔn
"Anyone who believes in the Son of God has this testimony in his heart. Anyone who does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because he has not believed the testimony God has given about his Son. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú Mawu ví ɔ́ é ɔ́, mɛ énɛ́ ɖó kúnnuɖiɖe énɛ́ ɔ́ ɖo ayi tɔn mɛ; mɛ e ma ka ɖi nǔ nú Mawu ǎ é sɔ́ Mawu dó ylɔ́ adingbannɔ; ɖó é ɖi nǔ nú kúnnu e Mawu ɖe nú vǐ tɔn é ǎ. "
"And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. ","Nǔ e ɖɔ wɛ kúnnuɖiɖe énɛ́ ɖe ɔ́ ɖíe: Mawu ná gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ mǐ, bɔ mǐ mɔ gbɛ énɛ́ gbɔn vǐ tɔn jí. "
He who has the Son has life,Fon
I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life. ,Un ɖo nǔ énɛ́ wlán sɛ́ dó mi wɛ bónú mi mɛ e ɖi nǔ nú Mawu ví ɔ́ lɛ́ɛ ná tunwun ɖɔ émí ɖó gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ. 
"This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. ","Mǐ ɖǒ gǎnjɛwú kpíkpé ɖo Mawu nukɔn ɖɔ mǐ byɔ́ nǔ ɖěbǔ nú é sɔgbe xá jlǒ tɔn ɔ́, é nɔ ɖótó mǐ. "
And if we know that he hears us–whatever we ask–we know that we have what we asked of him. ,"Ée mǐ tunwun ɖɔ hwenu e mǐ ɖo nǔɖé byɔ́ ɛ wɛ ɔ́, é nɔ ɖótó mǐ ɔ́, mǐ lɛ́ tunwun ɖɔ é nɔ ná nǔ e byɔ́ ɛ wɛ mǐ ɖe ɔ́ mǐ. "
"If anyone sees his brother commit a sin that does not lead to death, he should pray and God will give him life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that he should pray about that. ","Ényí mɛɖé mɔ nɔví tɔn ɖo hwɛ hu wɛ hǔn, mɛ ɔ́ ní xo ɖɛ n'i; énɛ́ ɔ́, Mawu ná ná gbɛ nɔví énɛ́.

"All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death. ",Nǔ nyanya wiwa bǐ wɛ nyí hwɛ
"We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the one who was born of God keeps him safe, and the evil one cannot harm him. ","Mǐ tunwun ɖɔ mɛ e nyí Mawu tɔn ɔ́ ɖěbǔ kún sɔ́ nɔ kpo ɖo hwɛ hu wɛ ó, ɖó Mawu ví ɔ́ cyɔ́n alɔ jǐ tɔn, bɔ Mɛnyanya ɔ́ sɔ́ nɔ kpé nǔ ɖěbǔ wú bó nɔ wa n'i ǎ. "

"We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true. And we are in him who is true–even in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. ","Mǐ tunwun ɖɔ Mawu ví ɔ́ wá, bó ná nǔnywɛ́ mǐ, nú mǐ ná dó tunwun Mawu nǔgbó ɔ́, bɔ mǐ ɖo bǔ xá Mawu nǔgbó ɔ́ gbɔn vǐ tɔn Jezu Klísu jí; é wɛ nyí Mawu nǔgbó ɔ́, bó nyí gbɛ mavɔ mavɔ. "

Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God,Fon
"If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take him into your house or welcome him. ","Ényí mɛɖé wá gɔ̌n mitɔn, bó ma hɛn kplɔ́n énɛ́ wá nú mi ǎ hǔn, mi ma yí i dó xwé mitɔn gbe ó; mi ma ka dó gbe e lɔ vɔ́vɔ́ ó. "

"So if I come, I will call attention to what he is doing, gossiping maliciously about us. Not satisfied with that, he refuses to welcome the brothers.

"The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.“To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands: ","Sunví tɛ́nwe e mɔ wɛ a ɖe ɖo alɔ ce ɖisí ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ kpó sikázogbɛ́nhɛnnú tɛ́nwe lɛ́ɛ kpó ɔ́, nǔbúdo e ɖe xlɛ́ wɛ yě ɖe ɔ́ ɖíe: sunví tɛ́nwe lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, agun Klísu tɔn tɛ́nwe lɛ́ɛ sín wɛnsagun lɛ́ɛ wɛ; bɔ zogbɛ́nhɛnnú tɛ́nwe lɛ́ɛ nyí agun Klísu tɔn tɛ́nwe lɛ́ɛ.”Wlǎn wěma sɛ́ dó agun Klísu tɔn e ɖo Efɛ́zi ɔ́ sín wɛnsagun, bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ: “Mɛ e hɛn sunví tɛ́nwe lɛ́ɛ dó alɔ tɔn ɖisí ɔ́ mɛ, bó ɖo zɔnlin ɖi wɛ ɖo sikázogbɛ́nhɛnnú tɛ́nwe lɛ́ɛ tɛ́ntin ɔ́, xó e ɖɔ wɛ é ɖe ɔ́ ɖíe: "

"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.”After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.” ","“Mɛ e ɖó tó bó ná dó se nǔ ɔ́ ní se nǔ e ɖɔ nú agun Klísu tɔn lɛ́ɛ wɛ Yɛsinsɛn ɖe ɔ́ ganjí.”Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, un ɖo nǔ kpɔ́n wɛ bó mɔ hɔn ɖé ɖo hunhun ɖo sɛ́xwé.

"At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it. ","Tlóló ɔ́, Yɛ wá jǐ ce, bɔ un mɔ axɔ́súzinkpo ɖokpó ɖo sɛ́xwé, bɔ mɛ ɖokpó ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n ɖo axɔ́súzinkpo énɛ́ jí. "
"And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian. A rainbow, resembling an emerald, encircled the throne.

"Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads.

"From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder. Before the throne, seven lamps were blazing. These are the seven spirits of God.

"Also before the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, and they were covered with eyes, in front and in back. ","Xu wěkpɛ́n ɖɔhun ɖé ɖo faɖaɖa ɖo axɔ́súzinkpo ɔ́ nukɔn, lobo cí awǐnnya e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ klísutalu ɔ́ ɖɔhun. Nǔɖogbɛ ɛnɛ ɖo tɛ́ntin, lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó axɔ́súzinkpo ɔ́.

"The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle.

"Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under his wings. Day and night they never stop saying: “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.” ","Nǔɖogbɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó ɖó awa ayizɛ́n; nukún kpé fí bǐ nú yě ɖo wěxo kpódó xomɛ kpó.

"Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever, ","Nǔɖogbɛ ɛnɛ lɛ́ɛ nɔ ji han dó kpá susu, dó wlí yɛ̌yi, dó dó kú nú mɛ e ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n ɖo axɔ́súzinkpo ɔ́ jí, bó ɖo gbɛ káká sɔ́yi é. Nú yě ɖo mɔ̌ bló wɛ hweɖěbǔnu ɔ́, "
"the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say: ","mɛxó ko-nukún-ɛnɛ lɛ́ɛ nɔ jɛ kpo ɖo mɛ e ɖo axɔ́súzinkpo ɔ́ jí, bó ɖo gbɛ káká sɔ́yi ɔ́ nukɔn, bó nɔ sɛn ɛ.

"“You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being.”Then I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals. ","“Aklúnɔ mǐtɔn, Mawu mǐtɔn, susu, yɛ̌yi kpó hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n kpó jɛ xá we, ɖó a blǒ nǔ bǐ; hwi wɛ jló bɔ yě tíin; hwi wɛ jló bɔ yě ɖo gbɛ.”Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, un mɔ wěma ɖé ɖo mlǎmlá ɖo mɛ e jínjɔ́n axɔ́súzinkpo jí ɔ́ sín alɔ ɖisí ɔ́ mɛ; è wlán nǔ dó wěma énɛ́ sín akpáxwé we lɛ́ɛ bǐ; è tlɛ́ wěma ɔ́ ɖo fí tɛ́nwe, bó ɖó wuntun jí.

"And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?” ","Un mɔ wɛnsagun hlɔ̌nhlɔ́nnɔ ɖokpó ɖo xó sú wɛ tlílí, bó nɔ ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌ é ka jɛ xá ɖɔ é nǐ gba wuntun lɛ́ɛ, bó hun wěma ɔ́.” "
But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it. ,"Lo ɔ́, mɛ ɖěbǔ ɖe ɖo jǐxwé ǎ; mɛɖé ɖe ɖo ayǐkúngban jí ǎ; mɛɖé ka ɖe ɖo ayǐkúngban glɔ́, bó ná sixú hun wěma ɔ́, abǐ bó ná sixú kpɔ́n xo tɔn mɛ ǎ. "
I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside. ,"Énɛ́ ɔ́, un ya avǐ ɖésú, ɖó è mɔ mɛ e jɛ xá ɖɔ é ní hun wěma ɔ́, abǐ ní kpɔ́n xo tɔn mɛ é ɖěbǔ ǎ. "
"Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.” ","Lo ɔ́, mɛxó lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó ɖɔ nú mì ɖɔ: “Ma ya avǐ ó, kpɔ́n: kinnikínní e ɖo akɔta Judáa tɔn mɛ, bó nyí axɔ́sú Davídi ví ɔ́ ɖu ɖ'é jí, bó ná gba wuntun tɛ́nwe lɛ́ɛ, bó ná hun wěma ɔ́.” "
"Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing in the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. ","Un mɔ Lɛ̌ngbɔ́ví ɖokpó ɖo te ɖo axɔ́súzinkpo ɔ́ tɛ́ntin; nǔɖogbɛ ɛnɛ lɛ́ɛ kpó mɛxó lɛ́ɛ kpó lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó e.

He came and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne. ,"Lɛ̌ngbɔ́ví ɔ́ sɛ yi nukɔn, bó yí wěma ɔ́ ɖo mɛ e jínjɔ́n axɔ́súzinkpo ɔ́ jí ɔ́ sín alɔ ɖisí ɔ́ mɛ. "
"And when he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. ","Ée é yí wěma ɔ́ é ɔ́, nǔɖogbɛ ɛnɛ lɛ́ɛ kpó mɛxó ko-nukún-ɛnɛ lɛ́ɛ kpán jɛ kpoli ɖo nukɔn tɔn. Yě mɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó hɛn agǐdigbo ɖokpó ɖokpó, bó lɛ́ hɛn sikákɔ́fu, bɔ zǎlínkpɔ́n gɔ́.

"And they sang a new song: “You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because you were slain, and with your blood you purchased men for God from every tribe and language and people and nation.

"Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels, numbering thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand. They encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders.

"Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, singing: “To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power, for ever and ever!” ","Un lɛ́ se nǔɖíɖó e ɖo jǐxwé lɛ́ɛ bǐ, ée ɖo ayǐkúngban jí lɛ́ɛ bǐ, ée ɖo ayǐkúngban glɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ, ée ɖo xu mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ; nǔɖíɖó e gbɔn wɛ̌kɛ́zo ɛnɛ lɛ́ɛ mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɖo ɖiɖɔ wɛ ɖɔ: “Kpikpa, yɛ̌yi, susu, kpódó hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n kpó ní nyí mɛ e ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n ɖo axɔ́súzinkpo ɔ́ jí é kpódó Lɛ̌ngbɔ́ví ɔ́ kpó tɔn káká sɔ́yi!” "
"The four living creatures said, “Amen,” and the elders fell down and worshiped.I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, “Come!” ","Nǔɖogbɛ ɛnɛ lɛ́ɛ yí gbe ɖɔ: “Amǐ!” Bɔ mɛxó lɛ́ɛ jɛ kpoli bó ɖe kɔ́.Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, wuntun tɛ́nwe lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, un mɔ Lɛ̌ngbɔ́ví ɔ́ gba nukɔntɔn ɔ́, bɔ un se nǔɖogbɛ ɛnɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó dó gbe jǐ dó gbe ɖɔhun, bó ɖɔ: “Wǎ!” "
"I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest. ","Un kpɔ́n lobo mɔ sɔ́ wěwé ɖokpó; mɛ e ɖo sɔ́ ɔ́ jí ɔ́ hɛn gǎ ɖokpó, bɔ è nǎ ɛ axɔ́súgbákún ɖokpó. É ɖidó mɛ ko ɖu ɖ'é jí ɖɔhun, bó ná ɖu ɖ'é jí. "

"Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make men slay each other. To him was given a large sword.

"When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come!” I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand.

"When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, Lɛ̌ngbɔ́ví ɔ́ gba wuntun atɔ́ɔ́ngɔ́ ɔ́, bɔ un mɔ mɛ e è hu, ɖó yě jlá Mawuxó ɔ́, bó nɔ gbejí ɖo kúnnuɖiɖe yětɔn mɛ lɛ́ɛ é sín lǐndɔ̌n ɖo vɔ̌sákpe ɔ́ glɔ́. "
"They called out in a loud voice, “How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?” ","Yě nɔ sú xó tlílí, bó nɔ ɖɔ: Aklúnɔ mímɛ́, Aklúnɔ nǔgbó nǔgbó, káká hwetɛ́nu wɛ a nǎ nɔ te yi jɛ, bó ná ɖɔ hwɛ xá mɛ e ɖo ayǐkúngban jí lɛ́ɛ, bó ná ba hlɔn nú mǐ, ɖó hu e yě hu mǐ ɔ́ wútu?

"Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and brothers who were to be killed as they had been was completed.

"I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red, ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, un mɔ Lɛ̌ngbɔ́ví ɔ́ gba wuntun ayizɛ́ngɔ́ ɔ́.

"and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as late figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind. ","Sunví lɛ́ɛ jɛ ayǐ sín jǐnukúnsin lě e jɔhɔn ɖaxó nɔ nyi, bó nɔ dán fígitín, bɔ sínsɛ́n tɔn mazin mazin lɛ́ɛ nɔ jɛ ayǐ gbɔn é. "
"The sky receded like a scroll, rolling up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place. ","Jǐnukúnsin mlá lě e è nɔ mlá wěma gbɔn é, bó bú; è ɖe só lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpódó ayǐkúngban e ɖo tɔ tɛ́ntin lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpán sín tɛn yětɔn yětɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ. "
"Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, and every slave and every free man hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains.

"For the great day of their wrath has come, and who can stand?”After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree. ","Đó xomɛsin yětɔn sín azǎn ɖaxó ɔ́ wá; mɛ̌ ka sixú nɔ te ɖo azǎn énɛ́ nukɔn?”Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, un mɔ wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn ɛnɛ ɖo te ɖo ayǐkúngban ɔ́ sín zo ɛnɛ lɛ́ɛ jí; yě hɛn jɔhɔn ayǐkúngban jí tɔn ɛnɛ lɛ́ɛ ɖó te, bónú jɔhɔn ɖěbǔ ma nyi dó ayǐkúngban ɔ́ ó, é ma nyi dó xu ó; é ma ka nyi dó atín ɖěbǔ ó.

"Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea: ","Un lɛ́ mɔ wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn ɖěvo tɔ́n sín zǎnzǎnhwe jí, bó hɛn wuntun Mawu gbɛɖe ɔ́ tɔn.

“Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.” ,“Mi ma to wa nǔ nyanya dó ayǐkúngban wú ó

"After this I looked and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, un lɛ́ kpɔ́n bó mɔ mɛ wɔ̌buwɔ́bú ɖé: mɛ ɖěbǔ sixú xa mɛ e ɖo ahwan ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ ǎ.

"And they cried out in a loud voice: “Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.” ","Yě sú xó tlílí ɖɔ: “Hwlɛngán mǐtɔn gosín Mawu mǐtɔn e jínjɔ́n axɔ́súzinkpo jí ɔ́ gɔ́n, bó gosín Lɛ̌ngbɔ́ví ɔ́ gɔ́n!” "
"All the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They fell down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, ","Wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ bǐ ɖo te bó lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó axɔ́súzinkpo ɔ́ kpó mɛxó lɛ́ɛ kpó, kpódó nǔɖogbɛ ɛnɛ lɛ́ɛ kpó.

"Then one of the elders asked me, “These in white robes–who are they, and where did they come from?” ",Mɛxó lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó kanbyɔ́ mì ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌ ka nyí mɛ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ e dó awu gaga wěwé é? Fítɛ́ yě gosín?” 
"I answered, “Sir, you know.” And he said, “These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

"Therefore, “they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple; and he who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them.

"Never again will they hunger; never again will they thirst. The sun will not beat upon them, nor any scorching heat. ",Xovɛ́ sɔ́ ná sin yě gbeɖé ǎ
"For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; he will lead them to springs of living water. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. ","Đó Lɛ̌ngbɔ́ví e ɖo axɔ́súzinkpo ɔ́ tɛ́ntin ɔ́ ná nyí Lɛ̌ngbɔ́nyitɔ́ yětɔn, bó ná kplá yě yi fí e sin ɖagbe e nɔ ná gbɛ mɛ ɔ́ nɔ tɔ́n sín lɛ́ɛ.

"And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and to them were given seven trumpets. ",bɔ un mɔ wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn tɛ́nwe e ɖo te Mawu nukɔn lɛ́ɛ. È fɔ kpɛn ɖaxó tɛ́nwe nú yě. 
"Another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense to offer, with the prayers of all the saints, on the golden altar before the throne. ","Wɛnsagun ɖěvo wá cí vɔ̌sákpe ɔ́ kpá; é hɛn nǔ e mɛ è nɔ fyɔ́ zǎlínkpɔ́n ɖe ɔ́ ɖokpó; siká wɛ è dó bló ná.

"The smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of the saints, went up before God from the angel's hand. ","Zǎlínkpɔ́n ɔ́ sín azizɔ nɔ sí sín wɛnsagun ɔ́ sín alɔ mɛ, bɔ azizɔ ɔ́ kpó mɛɖeɖóvo Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ sín ɖɛ kpó nɔ yi jǐ ɖo Mawu nukɔn. "
"Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it on the earth; and there came peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning and an earthquake.

Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them. ,"Wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn tɛ́nwe e hɛn kpɛn ɖaxó tɛ́nwe lɛ́ɛ ɖo nǔ sɔ́ wɛ, bó ná jɛ kpɛn ɖaxó lɛ́ɛ kún jí. "
"The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled down upon the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.

"The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain, all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood, ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, wɛnsagun wegɔ́ ɔ́ kún kpɛn, bɔ nǔ só ɖaxó ɖɔhun ɖé ɖo myɔ ji wɛ, bɔ è sɔ́ nyi xu mɛ, bɔ xu ɔ́ sín atɔnvlɔ́ɖó húzú kanjɔ. "

"The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water– ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, wɛnsagun atɔngɔ́ ɔ́ kún kpɛn bɔ sunví ɖaxó ɖé ɖo jiji wɛ zohwín ɖɔhun, bó jɛ ayǐ sín jǐxwé; é jɛ tɔ lɛ́ɛ kpódó tɔjɔtɛn lɛ́ɛ kpó sín atɔnvlɔ́ɖó jí.

"the name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become bitter. ","Sunví énɛ́ sín nyǐkɔ nɔ́ nyí vǐvɛ́, bɔ sin lɛ́ɛ sín atɔnvlɔ́ɖó vɛ́, bɔ mɛ e nu lɛ́ɛ gěgé kú, ɖó sin ɔ́ vɛ́ wútu. "
"The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them turned dark. A third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, wɛnsagun ɛnɛgɔ́ ɔ́ kún kpɛn, bɔ è dǒ nǔ hwe ɔ́ sín atɔnvlɔ́ɖó, bó dó nǔ sun sín atɔnvlɔ́ɖó, bó dó nǔ sunví lɛ́ɛ sín atɔnvlɔ́ɖó, bɔ kínkɔ́n yětɔn sín atɔnvlɔ́ɖó dó ablu; kéze sín atɔnvlɔ́ɖó sɔ́ nɔ ná wěziza ǎ; zǎn lɔ sín atɔnvlɔ́ɖó sɔ́ nɔ ná wěziza ǎ.

"As I watched, I heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a loud voice: “Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the other three angels!”The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss. ","Un lɛ́ kpɔ́n, bó mɔ gangan ɖokpó ɖo zinzɔn wɛ gbɔn jɔhɔn mɛ aga ɖéé; un se bɔ é ɖo xó sú wɛ tlílí ɖɔ: “Awo! Awo!

"When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace. The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss.

And out of the smoke locusts came down upon the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth. ,"Kle lɛ́ɛ tɔ́n sín azizɔ ɔ́ mɛ, bó gba kpé ayǐkúngban ɔ́ jí; è nǎ acɛ yě, bɔ é cí acɛ e hɔnkéklě lɛ́ɛ ɖó é ɖɔhun. "
"They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.

"They were not given power to kill them, but only to torture them for five months. And the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes a man.

And the four angels who had been kept ready for this very hour and day and month and year were released to kill a third of mankind. ,"Đe wɛnsagun ɛnɛ lɛ́ɛ nyi te; è ko sɔ́ nǔ nú yě ɖ'ayǐ nú gan énɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ pɛ́pɛ́pɛ́, ɖo azǎn énɛ́ ɔ́ gbe, nú azǎn énɛ́ ɔ́ ɖo sun énɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ, nú sun énɛ́ ɔ́ ɖo xwe énɛ́ ɔ́ mɛ, bónú yě ná hu gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ sín atɔnvlɔ́ɖó.

"Nor did they repent of their murders, their magic arts, their sexual immorality or their thefts.Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven. He was robed in a cloud, with a rainbow above his head; his face was like the sun, and his legs were like fiery pillars. ","Gbɛtɔ́ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ka lɛ́ lɛ́ kɔ sín mɛhuhu, majíkiblóbló, agalilɛ kpó ajojija kpó gúdo ǎ.Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, un mɔ wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn hlɔ̌nhlɔ́nnɔ ɖěvo, bɔ é ɖo te jɛ sín jǐxwé wɛ; akpɔ́kpɔ́ bú i; nyǐ ɖi lɛ́ lɛ̌ dó ta tɔn; nukún tɔn mɛ nɔ kɔ́n hwe ɖɔhun; zǎkɛ́tɛ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ cí myɔdotín ɖɔhun.

"He was holding a little scroll, which lay open in his hand. He planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land, ","É hɛn wěma kpɛví ɖokpó alɔ mɛ, bɔ é ɖo hunhun. É sɔ́ afɔ tɔn ɖisí ɔ́ ɖó xu jí, bó sɔ́ afɔ tɔn amyɔ ɔ́ ɖó ayǐkúngban jí. "
"and he gave a loud shout like the roar of a lion. When he shouted, the voices of the seven thunders spoke. ","É sú xó tlílí kinnikínní dó gbe ɖɔhun. Ée é sú xó fó ɔ́, so tɛ́nwe lɛ́ɛ dó gbe dó yí gbe n'i. "
"And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write it down.” ","Ée so tɛ́nwe lɛ́ɛ dó gbe fó ɔ́, un jló ná jɛ nǔ e yě ɖɔ lɛ́ɛ wlán jí, lo ɔ́, un se gbe ɖé sín jǐxwé, bɔ gbe ɔ́ ɖɔ nú mì ɖɔ: “Hɛn nǔ e so tɛ́nwe lɛ́ɛ ɖɔ é dó ayi mɛ; ma wlán ó.” "
Then the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven. ,"Wɛnsagun e un mɔ ɖo te ɖo xu kpódó ayǐkúngban kpán jí ɔ́ dlɛ́n alɔ tɔn ɖisí ɔ́ dó jǐxwé, "
"And he swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and all that is in them, the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it, and said, “There will be no more delay! ","bó xwlé nǔ dó Mawu nyǐkɔ mɛ.

"
"But in the days when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God will be accomplished, just as he announced to his servants the prophets.” ","Amɔ̌ hwenu e wɛnsagun tɛ́nwegɔ́ ɔ́ ná jɛ kpɛn kún jí ɔ́, nǔbúdo Mawu tɔn ná jɛ lě e é ko ɖɔ gbɔn nú mɛsɛntɔ́ tɔn gbeyíɖɔ lɛ́ɛ é.” "
"Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me once more: “Go, take the scroll that lies open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, gbe e un se sín jǐxwé ɖ'ayǐ ɔ́ lɛ́ ɖɔ xó élɔ́ lɛ́ɛ nú mì; é ɖɔ: “Yi yí wěma kpɛví e ɖo hunhun ɖo wɛnsagun e ɖo te ɖo xu kpódó ayǐkúngban kpán jí ɔ́ sín alɔ mɛ é.” "
"So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll. He said to me, “Take it and eat it. It will turn your stomach sour, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.” ","Nǔgbó ɔ́, un yi wɛnsagun ɔ́ gɔ́n bó ɖɔ n'i ɖɔ é ní sɔ́ wěma kpɛví ɔ́ nú mì.

"I took the little scroll from the angel's hand and ate it. It tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach turned sour. ","Un yí wěma kpɛví ɔ́ sín alɔ tɔn mɛ bó ɖu. É víví ɖo nu ce mɛ ɖi wǐin; ée un ka mi ɔ́, é húzú nǔ vívɛ́ ɖo adɔgo ce mɛ. "
"Then I was told, “You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages and kings.”I was given a reed like a measuring rod and was told, “Go and measure the temple of God and the altar, and count the worshipers there. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, è ɖɔ nú mì ɖɔ: “A ɖǒ ná lɛ́ dó wɛn Mawu tɔn e ɖɔ xó dó togun gěgé, to gěgé, gbe gěgé kpódó axɔ́sú gěgé kpán wú é.”Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, è sɔ́ fántín bǎ ɖɔhun ɖokpó dó así nú mì bó ɖɔ: “Yi jlɛ́ sinsɛnxɔ Mawu tɔn kpódó vɔ̌sákpe ɔ́ kpó, bó xa mɛ e ɖo Mawu sɛn wɛ ɖo sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́ mɛ lɛ́ɛ.

"But exclude the outer court; do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles. They will trample on the holy city for 42 months. ","Lo ɔ́, jǒ sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́ sín kɔ́xota dó; ma jlɛ́ ó; ɖó è ko sɔ́ kɔ́xota ɔ́ nú mɛ e ma nɔ sɛn Mawu ǎ lɛ́ɛ, bɔ yě ná gbídí toxo mímɛ́ ɔ́ ɖó afɔ wú káká nú sun kanɖé nukún-we (42). "
"And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.” ","Un ná sɛ́ kúnnuɖetɔ́ ce we lɛ́ɛ dó, bɔ yě ná dó ati; bó ná dó wɛn Mawu tɔn ɔ́ xɔ azǎn afatɔ́n afɔɖé kanɖé ko (1.260).” "
These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. ,Olívutín we lɛ́ɛ kpó zogbɛ́nhɛnnú we e ɖo te ɖo Aklúnɔ ayǐkúngban jí tɔn sín nukɔn ɔ́ kpó wɛ nyí kúnnuɖetɔ́ we énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ. 
"If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies. This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die. ","Ényí mɛɖé jló ná wa nǔ nyanya dó yě wú ɔ́, myɔ nɔ tɔ́n sín nu yětɔn mɛ bó nɔ fyɔ́ kɛntɔ́ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ. Lě e è ɖǒ ná hu mɛ e ná ba ná wa nǔ nyanya dó yě wú lɛ́ɛ gbɔn é nɛ́. "
These men have power to shut up the sky so that it will not rain during the time they are prophesying,Fon
"Now when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the Abyss will attack them, and overpower and kill them. ","Hwenu e yě ná dó wɛn e dó wɛ yě ɖe ɔ́ fó ɔ́, kanlin e ná tɔ́n sín domaɖó-azan ɔ́ mɛ ɔ́ ná tɔ́n ahwan yě; é ná ɖu ɖo yě jǐ, bó ná hu yě. "
"Their bodies will lie in the street of the great city, which is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified. ","Cyɔ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ ná cí toxo ɖaxó ɔ́ sín alixo, fí e è ká Aklúnɔ yětɔn nyi aklúzu jí ɖe é. Nú è ma jló ná ylɔ́ to ɔ́ sín nyǐkɔ ɖésú ǎ ɔ́, è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ Sodɔ́mu abǐ Ejípu. "
"For three and a half days men from every people, tribe, language and nation will gaze on their bodies and refuse them burial. ","Gbɛtɔ́ e ɖo togun lɛ́ɛ bǐ mɛ é, ée ɖo akɔta lɛ́ɛ bǐ mɛ é, ée ɖo gbe lɛ́ɛ bǐ mɛ é, kpódó gbɛtɔ́ e ɖo to lɛ́ɛ bǐ mɛ é kpó ná kpɔ́n cyɔ yětɔn nú azǎn atɔn adaɖé, bó ná lɔn nú è nǎ ɖi yě ǎ. "
"The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts, because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth.

"But after the three and a half days a breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and terror struck those who saw them. ","Amɔ̌, azǎn atɔn adaɖé énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ gúdo ɔ́, funfún e nɔ ná gbɛ mɛ ɔ́, gosín Mawu gɔ̌n, bó byɔ́ yě mɛ, bɔ yě fɔ́n sí te; énɛ́ ɔ́, xɛsi ɖaxó ɖé jɛ mɛ e ɖo yě mɔ wɛ lɛ́ɛ bǐ jǐ. "
"Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.” And they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies looked on. ","Gbeyíɖɔ we lɛ́ɛ se gbe ɖaxó ɖé ɖi sín jǐxwé, bɔ gbe ɔ́ ɖɔ nú yě ɖɔ: “Mi xá jǐ fí.” Bɔ hwenu e kɛntɔ́ yětɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖo yě kpɔ́n wɛ ɔ́, yě zɔn akpɔ́kpɔ́ ɖé mɛ yi jǐxwé. "
"At that very hour there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven. ","Hwenɛ́nu ɖokpó ɔ́, ayǐkúngban dán wǔ kpódó zǐngídi kpó, bɔ toxo ɔ́ sín wǒvlɔ́ɖó mu; ayǐkúngban énɛ́ e dán wǔ ɔ́ hu gbɛtɔ́ děgba ɖě afɔwó-afatɔ́n (7.000); énɛ́ ɔ́, xɛsi jɛ mɛ ɖě lɛ́ɛ jí, bɔ yě nɔ kpa susu nú Mawu jǐxwé tɔn.

The second woe has passed,Fon
"The seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, which said: “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign for ever and ever.” ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, wɛnsagun Mawu tɔn tɛ́nwegɔ́ ɔ́ kún kpɛn, bɔ gbe ɖaxó ɖé lɛ́ɛ ɖi ɖo jǐxwé bó ɖɔ: “Axɔ́súɖuɖu gbɛ ɔ́ tɔn nyí Aklúnɔ mǐtɔn kpó Klísu tɔn kpán tɔn lo!

"And the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God, ","Mɛxó ko-nukún-ɛnɛ e ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n ɖo axɔ́súzinkpo yětɔn lɛ́ɛ jí ɖo Mawu nukɔn lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, xwe agbɔ̌nnusú do, bó ɖe kɔ́ nú Mawu, "
"saying: “We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, the One who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and have begun to reign. ","bó ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ Mawu Nǔbǐwúkpétɔ́, hwi mɛ e tíin, bó ko tíin ɖ'ayǐ ɔ́, mǐ dó kú nú we, ɖó hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n towe ɖaxó e a sɔ́ dó wa azɔ̌ ná ɔ́ wú; mǐ dó kú nú we ɖó axɔ́sú e a jɛ ɖuɖu jí ɔ́ wútu. "
"The nations were angry; and your wrath has come. The time has come for judging the dead, and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your saints and those who reverence your name, both small and great– and for destroying those who destroy the earth.” ","To lɛ́ɛ ko ɖo adǎn jí ɖ'ayǐ, amɔ̌ hwenu e a nǎ ɖe xomɛsin towe xlɛ́ dó ɔ́ su; hwenu e a nǎ ɖɔ hwɛ xá mɛkúkú lɛ́ɛ dó ɔ́ su; hwenu e a nǎ ná ajɔ gbeyíɖɔ mɛsɛntɔ́ towe lɛ́ɛ dó ɔ́ su.

"Then God's temple in heaven was opened, and within his temple was seen the ark of his covenant. And there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake and a great hailstorm.A great and wondrous sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, è hun sinsɛnxɔ Mawu tɔn ɖo jǐxwé, bɔ è mɔ akɔjijɛgbá ɔ́ ɖ'é mɛ.

She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. ,"Nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ ɖo vǐ ná ji wɛ; é ɖo vǐjiji sín wǔvɛ́ lɛ́ɛ mɔ wɛ, bó ɖo xó sú wɛ. "
Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads. ,"Xlɛ̌ ɖěvo lɛ́ tɔ́n ɖo jǐxwé: è mɔ kanlin baɖabaɖa ɖaxó vɔvɔ ɖé; è nɔ ylɔ́ kanlin ɔ́ ɖɔ Dlagɔ́ɔn; é ɖó ta tɛ́nwe, bó ɖó zo wǒ, bɔ axɔ́súgbákún ɖokpó ɖokpó ɖo ta tɔn ɖokpó ɖokpó jí. "
"His tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that he might devour her child the moment it was born. ","É sɔ́ sí tɔn dó kplɔ́ sunví lɛ́ɛ sín atɔnvlɔ́ɖó sín jǐxwé nyi dó ayǐkúngban jí. É nɔ te ɖo nyɔ̌nu e ɖo vǐ ná ji wɛ ɔ́ nukɔn, bónú é ji vǐ ɔ́ tlóló ɔ́, é ná vún vǐ ɔ́ ɖu. "
"She gave birth to a son, a male child, who will rule all the nations with an iron scepter. And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne. ","Nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ ji vǐ súnnu ɖokpó. Vǐ ɔ́ ná kpa acɛ dó to lɛ́ɛ bǐ nu, bɔ acɛkpikpa tɔn ná syɛ́n gankpo ɖɔhun. È ka wá zé vǐ ɔ́ yi Mawu kpó axɔ́súzinkpo tɔn kpó kɔn; "
"The woman fled into the desert to a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days. ","bɔ nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ hɔn yi gbětótló mɛ, fí e Mawu ko bló tɛnmɛ ɖó ɖ'ayǐ n'i ɖe é, bónú è nǎ ná nǔɖuɖu i xɔ azǎn afatɔ́n afɔɖé kanɖé ko (1.260). "
"And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. ","Bɔ ahwan tɔ́n ɖo jǐxwé: wɛnsagun ɖaxó Micɛ́li kpódó wɛnsagun e ɖo glɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó fun ahwan xá Dlagɔ́ɔn ɔ́, bɔ Dlagɔ́ɔn ɔ́ kpódó wɛnsagun tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó fun ahwan xá yě. "
"But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. ","Lo ɔ́, yě ka ɖu ɖo Dlagɔ́ɔn ɔ́ jí, bɔ è sɔ́ ná gbe é kpódó wɛnsagun tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó ɖɔ yě ní nɔ jǐxwé ǎ. "
"The great dragon was hurled down–that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him. ","È zě Dlagɔ́ɔn ɖaxó ɔ́ nyi dó ayǐkúngban jí; é wɛ nyí dan xóxó e è nɔ ylɔ́ ɖɔ awǒvi abǐ Satáan é; é wɛ flú gbɛ ɔ́ bǐ. È zě e nyi dó ayǐkúngban jí, é kpódó wɛnsagun tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó. "
"Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: “Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ. For the accuser of our brothers, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, un se gbe ɖaxó ɖé ɖi sín jǐxwé bó ɖɔ: “Hwlɛngán sín hwenu su lo!

They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony,Fon
"Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short.” ","Énɛ́ wú ɔ́, sɛ́xwé kpó mi mɛ e ɖo sɛ́xwé lɛ́ɛ kpó ní jɛ awǎ. Amɔ̌ heelú ayǐkúngban kpó xu kpó.

"When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. ","Ée Dlagɔ́ɔn ɔ́ mɔ ɖɔ è nyi émí dó ayǐkúngban jí é ɔ́, é jɛ nyɔ̌nu e ji vǐ súnnu ɔ́ gúdo. "
"The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the desert, where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent's reach. ","Lo ɔ́, è nǎ gangan ɖaxó sín awa we nyɔ̌nu ɔ́, bónú é ná zɔn yi tɛn tɔn mɛ ɖo gbětótló mɛ, fí e è nǎ ná ɛ nǔɖuɖu ɖe xɔ xwe atɔn adaɖé é; fí e dan ɔ́ ma ná wlí i ɖe ǎ é. "
"Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent. ","Bɔ dan ɔ́ tún sin sín nu mɛ bɔ é cí tɔsisa ɖɔhun ɖo nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ gúdo, bó ná dó dɔn nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ hɛn yi. "
But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth. ,"Lo ɔ́, ayǐkúngban hwlɛ́n nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ gán: ayǐkúngban ɔ́ hun nu, bó nu sin e Dlagɔ́ɔn ɔ́ tún sín nu mɛ é. "
"Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to make war against the rest of her offspring–those who obey God's commandments and hold to the testimony of Jesus.And the dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. He had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on his horns, and on each head a blasphemous name. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́, xomɛ sin Dlagɔ́ɔn ɔ́ dó nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ wú tlala, bɔ é ɖidó ahwan fun xá nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ sín vǐ e kpo lɛ́ɛ gbé; mɛ e se tónú nú Mawusɛ́n ɔ́, bó ɖo gbejí nú nǔgbó e Jezu ɖe xlɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, é ɖidó ahwan fun xá yě bǐ gbé.Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, un mɔ kanlin ɖé tɔ́n sín xu mɛ; é ɖó zo wǒ, bó ɖó ta tɛ́nwe; é xwe axɔ́súgbákún ɖokpó ɖokpó ɖó zo tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó ɖokpó jí; è wlǎn nu nylá dó Mawu wú sín nyǐkɔ dó ta tɔn lɛ́ɛ wú. "
"The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority. ","Kanlin e un mɔ ɔ́ ɖi kpɔ; afɔ tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖi lɔnmɔ sín afɔ; nu tɔn ɖi kinnikínní sín nu. Dlagɔ́ɔn ɔ́ sɔ́ hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n tɔn jó n'i, bó sɔ́ axɔ́súzinkpo tɔn kpódó acɛ tɔn ɖaxó ɔ́ kpó jó n'i. "
"One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was astonished and followed the beast. ","É cí è gblě wǔ i dó ta tɔn lɛ́ɛ ɖokpó ɖɔ ní kú ɖɔhun; lo ɔ́, wǔ e è gblě e ɖɔ ní kú ɔ́, akpa tɔn ko kú. Nǔ tɔn nyɔ́ gbɛtɔ́ e ɖo ayǐkúngban jí lɛ́ɛ bǐ nukún mɛ, bɔ yě ɖo gǔdo tɔn. "
"Men worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, “Who is like the beast? Who can make war against him?” ","Mɛ bǐ jɛ Dlagɔ́ɔn ɔ́ sɛn jí, ɖó é zé acɛ tɔn jó nú kanlin ɔ́; yě nɔ sɛn kanlin ɔ́ lɔmɔ̌, bó nɔ ɖɔ: “Mɛ̌ ká cí kanlin ɔ́ ɖɔhun? Mɛ̌ ká sixú fun ahwan xá ɛ?” "
The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise his authority for forty-two months. ,"È nǎ gbe kanlin ɔ́ ɖɔ ní ɖɔ xó, bó dó yí go Mawu wú, bó ɖɔ xó dó zun Mawu; è ná ɛ acɛ ɖɔ ní wa mɔ̌ xɔ sun kanɖé nukún-we (42). "
"He opened his mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven. ","É jɛ xó nyanya ɖɔ dó Mawu wǔ jí; é jɛ xó nyanya ɖɔ dó Mawu kpó nɔtɛn tɔn kpó wú jí, bó jɛ mɛ e nɔ nɔ jǐxwé lɛ́ɛ zun jí. "
"He was given power to make war against the saints and to conquer them. And he was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation. ","È ná ɛ gbe ɖɔ ní fun ahwan xá mɛɖeɖóvo Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ, bó ɖu ɖo yě jǐ; è ná ɛ acɛ dó akɔta lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpó togun lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpó nu; é ná ɛ acɛ dó gbe lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpó to lɛ́ɛ bǐ kpó nu. "
All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast–all whose names have not been written in the book of life belonging to the Lamb that was slain from the creation of the world. ,"Mɛ e ɖo ayǐkúngban jí lɛ́ɛ bǐ ná nɔ sɛn ɛ: yě mɛ e sín nyǐkɔ è ma wlán dó Lɛ̌ngbɔ́ví e è hu ɔ́ sín wěma mɛ ǎ lɛ́ɛ ná sɛn ɛ.

"He who has an ear, let him hear. ","“Ényí mi ɖó tó bó ná dó se nǔ hǔn, mi bo ɖótó ganjí. "
"If anyone is to go into captivity, into captivity he will go. If anyone is to be killed with the sword, with the sword he will be killed. This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of the saints. ","Mɛ e ɖo te nú gankpá mɛ ɔ́ ɖó ná yi gankpá mɛ; mɛ e ɖo te nú hwǐ kú ɔ́ ɖó ná kú hwǐ kú; nǔ énɛ́ ɔ́ byɔ́ ɖɔ mɛɖeɖóvo Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ ní dɛ, bó ɖó nǔɖiɖi.” "
"Then I saw another beast, coming out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, but he spoke like a dragon. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, un mɔ kanlin ɖěvo bɔ é ɖo ayǐkúngban glɔ́ tɔ́n sín wɛ; é ɖó zo we, bɔ zo lɛ́ɛ cí Lɛ̌ngbɔ́ví sín zo ɖɔhun; é ɖo xó ɖɔ wɛ Dlagɔ́ɔn ɖɔhun. "
"He exercised all the authority of the first beast on his behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed. ",É nɔ zán acɛ e kanlin nukɔntɔn ɔ́ ɖó ɔ́ bǐ ɖo nukɔn tɔn. É zɔ́n bɔ ayǐkúngban ɔ́ kpó mɛ e ɖ'é jí lɛ́ɛ kpó nɔ sɛn kanlin nukɔntɔn e wǔ e è gblě e ɖɔ ní kú ɔ́ sín akpa ko kú é. 
"And he performed great and miraculous signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in full view of men. ","Kanlin wegɔ́ énɛ́ ɔ́, nɔ jlɛ́ nǔ ɖaxó ɖaxó lɛ́ɛ; é nɔ dɔn myɔ sín jǐxwé wá ayǐkúngban jí ɖo gbɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ bǐ nukɔn. "
"Because of the signs he was given power to do on behalf of the first beast, he deceived the inhabitants of the earth. He ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived. ","É nɔ zé nǔ e è nǎ gbe e ɖɔ é ní jlɛ́ ɖo kanlin nukɔntɔn ɔ́ nukɔn ɔ́ dó flú gbɛtɔ́ e ɖo ayǐkúngban jí lɛ́ɛ ná.

"He was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that it could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. ","È nǎ gbe kanlin wegɔ́ ɔ́ ɖɔ ní ná gbɛ kanlin nukɔntɔn ɔ́ sín akpajlɛ́, bónú akpajlɛ́ énɛ́ ɔ́ ná sixú ɖɔ xó, bónú é ná sixú hu mɛ e ma ná nɔ sɛn ɛ ǎ lɛ́ɛ bǐ. "
"He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, ","Kanlin ɔ́ zɔ́n bɔ è ɖǒ wuntun alɔ ɖisí ɔ́, abǐ nukɔn nú mɛ bǐ: yɔkpɔ́vú kpó mɛxó kpó; dɔkunnɔ kpó wamamɔnɔ kpó; kannumɔ kpó mɛ e ɖo éɖée sí ɔ́ kpó. "
"so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name. ","Ényí mɛɖé ma ɖó wuntun énɛ́ ɔ́ ǎ ɔ́, é sixú xɔ nǔ ǎ; é ka sixú sa nǔ ǎ. Wuntun ɔ́ wɛ nyí kanlin ɔ́ sín nyǐkɔ, abǐ xixa nabí e nyǐkɔ tɔn nyí é. "
"This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is man's number. His number is 666.Then I looked, and there before me was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads. ","Nǔ énɛ́ lɛ́ɛ byɔ́ ɖɔ è ɖǒ ná ɖó nǔnywɛ́.

And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps. ,Un se gbe ɖé sín jǐxwé bɔ é ɖo nǔ ɖɔ wɛ sin ɖaxó ɖé wɛ ɖo ayǐ kɔn nyi wɛ ɖɔhun
"And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. ","Gbɛtɔ́ adɔ̌kpo tɛ́nwe děgba (144.000) nɛ́ lɛ́ɛ ɖo te ɖo axɔ́súzinkpo ɔ́ nukɔn, ɖo nǔɖogbɛ ɛnɛ lɛ́ɛ kpó mɛxó lɛ́ɛ kpó nukɔn, bó ɖo han yɔ̌yɔ́ ɖé jí wɛ.

"These are those who did not defile themselves with women, for they kept themselves pure. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were purchased from among men and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb.

"
No lie was found in their mouths,Fon
"Then I saw another angel flying in midair, and he had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth–to every nation, tribe, language and people. ","Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, un mɔ wɛnsagun ɖěvo, bɔ é ɖo zinzɔn wɛ gbɔn jɔhɔn mɛ aga; é ɖó Wɛn Ɖagbe mavɔ mavɔ ɖé bó ná dó mɛ e ɖo ayǐkúngban jí lɛ́ɛ; é ná dó wɛn ɔ́ to bǐ, akɔta bǐ, gbe bǐ kpódó togun bǐ kpó.

"He said in a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea and the springs of water.” ","Wɛnsagun ɔ́ zé gbe yi jǐ bó ɖɔ: “Mi ɖó sísí nú Mawu, bó kpa susu n'i!

"A second angel followed and said, “Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great, which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries.” ","Wɛnsagun wegɔ́ ɔ́ jɛ nukɔntɔn ɔ́ gúdo, bó ɖɔ: “É jɛ ayǐ lóóo!

"A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: “If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on the forehead or on the hand, ","Wɛnsagun atɔngɔ́ ɔ́ jɛ we nukɔntɔn lɛ́ɛ gúdo, bó zé gbe yi jǐ bó ɖɔ: “Mɛ e ɖo kanlin ɔ́ kpó akpajlɛ́ tɔn kpó sɛn wɛ, lobo yí wuntun tɔn dó nukɔn, abǐ dó alɔ ɔ́, "
"he, too, will drink of the wine of God's fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. He will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb. ","mɛ énɛ́ ɖésú ná nu vɛ̌ɛn Mawu tɔn; adǎn tɔn sín vɛ̌ɛn e é kɔn akú tɔn dó xomɛsin tɔn sín kɔ́fu mɛ é!

"And the smoke of their torment rises for ever and ever. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and his image, or for anyone who receives the mark of his name.” ","Myɔ e ná dó ya ɖaxó nú yě ɔ́ sín azizɔ ná ɖo sisi wɛ káká sɔ́yi.

This calls for patient endurance on the part of the saints who obey God's commandments and remain faithful to Jesus. ,"Nǔ e wú é byɔ́ ɖɔ mɛɖeɖóvo Mawu tɔn e nɔ xwedó Mawusɛ́n lɛ́ɛ, bó ɖó nǔɖiɖi nú Jezu lɛ́ɛ ɖó ná dɛ ɔ́ nɛ́. "
"Then I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “they will rest from their labor, for their deeds will follow them.” ","Un se gbe ɖé bɔ gbe ɔ́ ɖɔ nú mì sín jǐxwé ɖɔ: “Wlǎn nǔ élɔ́: ‘Mɛ e ɖo kúkú wɛ ɖo Aklúnɔ mɛ bɛ́ sín din lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, nǔ nyɔ́ nú yě!’ ” Yɛ ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Ɛɛn nǔgbó wɛ, yě hɛn ɔ́, yě ná gbɔjɛ́ ɖo azɔ̌ syɛ́nsyɛ́n e yě wa lɛ́ɛ mɛ, ɖó ɖagbe e yě wa lɛ́ɛ kpó yě kpo ɖo yiyi wɛ.” "
"I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one “like a son of man” with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. ","Un lɛ́ ɖo kpínkpɔ́n wɛ bó mɔ akpɔ́kpɔ́ wěwé ɖé, bɔ nǔ gbɛtɔ́ ɖɔhun ɖé ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n ɖ'é jí. Axɔ́súgbákún e è sɔ́ siká dó bló ná ɔ́ ɖokpó ɖo ta tɔn, bɔ é hɛn nǔkún-yanú ɖíɖá ɖokpó alɔ mɛ. "
"Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud, “Take your sickle and reap, because the time to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.” ","Wɛnsagun ɖěvo tɔ́n sín sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́ mɛ, bó sú xó tlílí, bó ɖɔ sɛ́ dó mɛ e ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n ɖo akpɔ́kpɔ́ ɔ́ jí ɔ́ ɖɔ: “Zě nǔkún-yanú towe dó ya nǔkún, ɖó nǔkún-yahwenu ko su; ɖó nǔkún e ɖo ayǐkúngban jí lɛ́ɛ ko myá.” "
"So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested. ",Bɔ mɛ e ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n ɖo akpɔ́kpɔ́ ɔ́ jí ɔ́ zé nǔkún-yanú tɔn dó kplɔ́ nǔkún lɛ́ɛ ná ɖo ayǐkúngban ɔ́ jí
"Another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle. ",Wɛnsagun ɖěvo lɛ́ tɔ́n sín sinsɛnxɔ e ɖo jǐxwé ɔ́ mɛ
"Still another angel, who had charge of the fire, came from the altar and called in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, “Take your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth's vine, because its grapes are ripe.” ","Bɔ wɛnsagun ɖěvo e ɖó acɛ dó myɔ ɔ́ jí ɔ́ gosín vɔ̌sákpe ɔ́ kɔn wá.

"The angel swung his sickle on the earth, gathered its grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God's wrath. ","Wɛnsagun ɔ́ nyi nǔkún-yanú tɔn dó kplɔ́ vǐwun sín hwǐn lɛ́ɛ ná ɖo ayǐkúngban ɔ́ jí, bɔ vǐwun sín hwǐn e ɖo ayǐkúngban jí lɛ́ɛ nyí gbigbo, bɔ è bɛ̌ nyi dó xomɛsin Mawu tɔn sín vǐwunfyɔ́nnú ɖaxó ɔ́ mɛ. "
"They were trampled in the winepress outside the city, and blood flowed out of the press, rising as high as the horses' bridles for a distance of 1,600 stadia.I saw in heaven another great and marvelous sign: seven angels with the seven last plagues–last, because with them God's wrath is completed. ","È li vǐwun sínsɛ́n ɔ́ ɖo vǐwunto mɛ, ɖo toxo ɔ́ gúdo, bɔ hun nɔ sa sín vǐwunto ɔ́ mɛ hoho, bó gba kpé kɔ́ mɛ káká yi kilomɛ́tlu afɔɖé kanwe ko (300), bɔ do yiyi tɔn yi mɛ̌tlu ɖokpó adaɖé mɔ̌.Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, un mɔ xlɛ́ ɖěvo ɖo jǐxwé; xlɛ́ énɛ́ ɔ́ d'agba bó nyɔ́ kpɔ́n: wɛnsagun tɛ́nwe ɖé lɛ́ɛ wɛ, bɔ yě hɛn nǔ nyanya tɛ́nwe.

"And I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire and, standing beside the sea, those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and over the number of his name. They held harps given them by God ","Un mɔ nǔ xu wěkpɛ́n ɖɔhun ɖé cáká kpó myɔ kpó; un lɛ́ mɔ yě mɛ e ɖu ɖo kanlin ɔ́ jí, bó ɖu ɖo akpajlɛ́ tɔn jí, bó ɖu ɖo xixa nabí e nyǐkɔ tɔn nyí ɔ́ jí lɛ́ɛ.

"and sang the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb: “Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are your ways, King of the ages. ","Yě ɖo mɛsɛntɔ́ Mawu tɔn Mɔyízi sín han ji wɛ, bó ɖo Lɛ̌ngbɔ́ví ɔ́ sín han ji wɛ ɖɔ: “Aklúnɔ Mawu Nǔbǐwúkpétɔ́, azɔ̌ towe lɛ́ɛ d'agba bó nyɔ́ kpɔ́n.

"Who will not fear you, O Lord, and bring glory to your name? For you alone are holy. All nations will come and worship before you, for your righteous acts have been revealed.” ","Aklúnɔ, mɛ̌ ma ká ná ɖó sísí nú we ǎ? Mɛ̌ ka ná gbɛ́ ɖɔ émí kún ná kpa susu nú we ó?

"After this I looked and in heaven the temple, that is, the tabernacle of the Testimony, was opened. ",Un mɔ sinsɛnxɔ e mɛ akɔjijɛ Mawu tɔn sín goxɔ ɖe ɔ́ hun ɖo jǐxwé. 
"Out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues. They were dressed in clean, shining linen and wore golden sashes around their chests.

"And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, “Go, pour out the seven bowls of God's wrath on the earth.” ","Azizɔ gɔ́ sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́ mɛ, ɖó susu Mawu tɔn kpó hlɔ̌nhlɔ́n tɔn kpó wú, bɔ mɛ ɖěbǔ sixú byɔ́ sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́ mɛ káká jɛ hwenu e nǔ nyanya tɛ́nwe e wɛnsagun lɛ́ɛ hɛn ɔ́ ná jɛ dó é ǎ.Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, un se gbe ɖi lélé sín sinsɛnxɔ ɔ́ mɛ, bó ɖo ɖiɖɔ nú wɛnsagun tɛ́nwe lɛ́ɛ wɛ ɖɔ: “Mi yi húzú xomɛsin Mawu tɔn e ɖo sinnugannú tɛ́nwe mɛ lɛ́ɛ kɔn nyi ayǐkúngban jí!” "
"The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land, and ugly and painful sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped his image.

"They were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of God, who had control over these plagues, but they refused to repent and glorify him.

"Then I saw three evil spirits that looked like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet.

"Then there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder and a severe earthquake. No earthquake like it has ever occurred since man has been on earth, so tremendous was the quake. ",Jǐkɛwun
"The great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed. God remembered Babylon the Great and gave her the cup filled with the wine of the fury of his wrath.

Every island fled away and the mountains could not be found. ,"Tɔtɛ́ntin yíkúngban lɛ́ɛ bǐ bú, bɔ è sɔ́ mɔ só lɛ́ɛ ɖě ǎ. "
"From the sky huge hailstones of about a hundred pounds each fell upon men. And they cursed God on account of the plague of hail, because the plague was so terrible.One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the punishment of the great prostitute, who sits on many waters.

With her the kings of the earth committed adultery and the inhabitants of the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries.” ,"Axɔ́sú e ɖo ayǐkúngban jí lɛ́ɛ lɛ aga xá ɛ, bɔ mɛ e ɖo ayǐkúngban jí lɛ́ɛ nu nǔblíblí tɔn sín vɛ̌ɛn mú.” "
Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a desert.

This title was written on her forehead: MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. ,"È wlǎn nyǐkɔ ɖé dó nukɔn tɔn; nyǐkɔ ɔ́ búdo. È wlǎn ɖɔ: “Babilɔ́nu ɖaxó ɔ́, agalɛtɔ́ lɛ́ɛ kpó suɖunú gbɛ ɔ́ tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpó sín nɔ.” "
"I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus. When I saw her, I was greatly astonished. ","Un mɔ ɖɔ mɛɖeɖóvo Mawu tɔn lɛ́ɛ kpódó kúnnuɖetɔ́ Jezu tɔn e è hu lɛ́ɛ kpó sín hun mú nyɔ̌nu ɔ́. Ée un mɔ nyɔ̌nu ɔ́, é kpácá mì ɖésú. "
"Then the angel said to me: “Why are you astonished? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides, which has the seven heads and ten horns.

"The beast, which you saw, once was, now is not, and will come up out of the Abyss and go to his destruction. The inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the creation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast, because he once was, now is not, and yet will come.

“This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits. ,"“Nǔ énɛ́ ɔ́ byɔ́ ɖɔ è ɖǒ ná ɖó nukúnnú mɔ jɛ nǔ mɛ kpó nǔnywɛ́ kpó. Ta tɛ́nwe lɛ́ɛ ɔ́, só tɛ́nwe wɛ; yě jí wɛ nyɔ̌nu ɔ́ ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n ɖe; yě lɛ́ nyí axɔ́sú tɛ́nwe. "
"They are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; but when he does come, he must remain for a little while. ","Mɛ atɔ́ɔ́n jɛ ayǐ ɖo yě mɛ; mɛ ɖokpó ɖo axɔ́sú ɖu wɛ din; mɛ tɛ́nwegɔ́ ɔ́ ka ko wá ǎ; hwenu e é ná wá ɔ́, hwenu kpɛɖé jɛ́n é ná nɔ ayǐ ná. "
"The beast who once was, and now is not, is an eighth king. He belongs to the seven and is going to his destruction. ","Kanlin e nɔ gbɛ ɖ'ayǐ, bó ma sɔ́ ɖo gbɛ din ǎ ɔ́, axɔ́sú tántɔngɔ́ ɔ́ wɛ é ɖésú nyí, bó lɛ́ ɖo mɛ tɛ́nwe nukɔntɔn lɛ́ɛ mɛ, lobo ná yi dɔn. "
"“The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast.

"They will make war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will overcome them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings–and with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers.” ","Yě ná fun ahwan xá Lɛ̌ngbɔ́ví ɔ́.

The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked,Fon
"For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to give the beast their power to rule, until God's words are fulfilled. ","Đó Mawu sɔ́ jlǒ e nɔ wa linlin tɔn ɔ́ dó ayi mɛ nú yě; yě ná ɖó gbe kpɔ́, bó wa nǔ, bó ná sɔ́ axɔ́súɖuɖu yětɔn dó así nú kanlin ɔ́ káká yi jɛ hwenu e xó e Mawu ɖɔ lɛ́ɛ ná jɛ dó é. "
"The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.”After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor. ","“Bó ná dó fó ɔ́, nyɔ̌nu e a mɔ ɔ́, toxo ɖaxó e kpa acɛ dó axɔ́sú ayǐkúngban jí tɔn lɛ́ɛ nu ɔ́ wɛ.”Énɛ́ ɔ́ gúdo ɔ́, un mɔ wɛnsagun ɖěvo ɖo te jɛ sín jǐxwé wɛ.

"With a mighty voice he shouted: “Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great! She has become a home for demons and a haunt for every evil spirit, a haunt for every unclean and detestable bird.

"For all the nations have drunk the maddening wine of her adulteries. The kings of the earth committed adultery with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries.” ","Đó é ná aga e é lɛ ɔ́ sín vɛ̌ɛn baɖabaɖa ɔ́ to lɛ́ɛ bǐ, bɔ yě nu.

Give back to her as she has given,Fon
"Give her as much torture and grief as the glory and luxury she gave herself. In her heart she boasts, ‘I sit as queen; I am not a widow, and I will never mourn.’ ","Lě e é nɔ sɔ́ éɖée su, bó nɔ ba acɔ́ sɔ ɔ́, mɔ̌ wɛ mi ná dó ya n'i sɔ, mɔ̌ wɛ mi ná dó e aluwɛ mɛ sɔ; ɖó é nɔ ɖɔ dó ayi mɛ ɖɔ: ‘Un ɖo ayǐjínjɔ́n fí, axɔ́sú nyɔ̌nu ɖɔhun; un nyí asúkúsi ǎ; un ka ná nɔ aluwɛ mɛ gbeɖé ǎ.’ "
"Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her: death, mourning and famine. She will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.

"Terrified at her torment, they will stand far off and cry: “ ‘Woe! Woe, O great city, O Babylon, city of power!

"In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin!’ “Every sea captain, and all who travel by ship, the sailors, and all who earn their living from the sea, will stand far off.

I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony for Jesus and because of the word of God.
